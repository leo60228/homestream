    "commentary": "<i>James Dever:</i>\n<i>(original commentary)</i>\nSburb is my proudest accomplishment. It is the bastard child of my hopes and dreams and my most recent accomplishments and ordeals. I set out to write music to capture everything going on in my life as well as find out who I am and what I am as far as a composer. What ended up happening was the creation of twelve powerful pieces that are close and dear to me and are a road map of my trials. The album has a biblical theme with the titles as to fit with the concept of the story of Homestuck being that of creation. Sburb ends up being the catalyst for the existence of our universes and every other one. I hope you appreciate them! These are my comments about each piece as well as a few comments on how exactly I played some of the crazier parts.\nEnjoy!\n<b>In Loving Memory of Linda Wright</b>\nWithout her words of encouragement and pushing me the whole way, I would not be half the man I am today. She was my savior during the worsttime of my life. She inspired me to finish this album, which I almost could not bring myself to do after her passing away. I miss you more than anything, grandma.\n<b>Thank you so much:</b>\nThe Quintanas, the Diguiseppis, the Emmons', Mr. Saliman and Mr. Spare for helping me survive the last year.\nThe Diguiseppis for giving me a roof over my head.\nJess, Mr. Emmons and the Farrells for putting up with me and teaching me everything I know about music.\nAunt Tammy for always protecting me and supporting any decision I make.\nMy friends for pushing me to not give up what I love the most.\nAndrew Hussie for this opportunity. For Homestuck.\nJeremy Iamurri for beating sense into me and being a great friend.\nErik Scheele for being absolutely amazing at what you do and performing this album.\nRJ Lake for pushing me to be better.\nThe music team for pushing me, and being the biggest group of bros in existence.\nYou. For listening.\n<i>(commentary redux)</i>\nOriginally written for Homestuck in 2011, Sburb is the first major composition I ever wrote. The pieces were written when I was seventeen, over my junior and senior years of high school and performed and recorded the following summer. The album released about a month before I set off to college and the whole experience was phenomenal.\nWhile I have long lost track with MSPA, I still am good friends with my fellow musicians from the Homestuck Music team including Erik \"Jit\" Steele, who performed on these recordings.\nLooking back on it now, I love how obvious my early inspirations are but I do love the work I was able to create during one of the most tumultuous times in my life. Thanks for listening.",

It actually came about from me trying to figure out the chords the harps play in the quiet last section of Saturn from Gustav Holst's The Planets. When I started writing Sburb I decided that it would fit perfectly with the theme that the game creates. The structure of the chords is not unlike how the game actually functions. They work as a juxtaposition of good and evil by using relative major and minor chords. It starts off quietly and on higher octaves to introduce the mood. The next section brings in the Homestuck Anthem as an introduction to the album itself, signaling the beginning of the entire process. The piece suddenly grows in intensity as the left hand C octave ostinatos enter the phrases followed by the calm of the storm. The piece does not resolve, however it does lead straight into the next.\n<i>(commentary redux)</i>\nThe introduction to the suite lays the fundamentals and ideas present throughout the rest of the movements. A juxtaposition between major and minor are in every chord creating a backbone of polytonality that I wanted to explore as I formulated the album.\nThe main Homestuck anthem is weaved through the chords as this album was originally written for and published through MS Paint Adventures and What Pumpkin. The original theme was composed by Clark Powell.\nThe album in its entirety is performed by Erik Scheele.",

Genesis marks the beginning of the biblical terms as well. The Book of Genesis is the first book of both the Hebrew Bible and Christian Old Testament. It is interpreted as the Chosen People being lead to the Promised Land. Sburb is the pathway that leads the kids into the game that is suppose to eventually grow a new universe. It starts off quietly and builds into a fast paced journey. Genesis also introduces my favorite music technique: hemiolas. The right hand plays a melody in triplets while the left hand harmonizes in eighth notes. This creates a strange rhythm and continues the juxtaposition theme created in The Prelude's chords. Continuing the concept of two extremes but together, the song goes into legato, quiet phrases that are immediately followed by staccato, loud phrases.\n<i>(commentary redux)</i>\nThe previous track sets up the resolution that the opening measures provide here. This movement introduces the two against three polyrhythm idea that continues throughout the album as well as a few choice hemiolas. Coming from a percussion background, I find a lot of melodic potential in rhythmic content and this whole suite was a place for me to test that out.",

It is suppose to be a beautiful, blissful utopia. It also becomes the origin of sin. The piece reflects that concept. The flowing and adventurous nature of the piece is suppose to reflect the beauty and majestic qualities of the land. As far as the kids story goes, it represents the infinite potential of Skaia. This song also continues the same hemiola motif as Creation with triplets played by the right hand and eighth notes played by the left. The glissandos at the beginning and in the middle is an E flat pentatonic run, which basically means I only played on the black keys. Since it's completely ad libbed I wrote out a small little example. Basically, the left hand just continues up normally while the right hand goes back and forth while slowly climbing up (if looking at the sheet music, each note alternates on the hands).\n<i>(commentary redux)</i>\nThe goal here was to feel like a breath of air after the first two movements had a much more minor modal center. The three over two polyrhythm keeps powering through the movement as I start introducing bass ostinati that act as the pedal tone to the melodic content.\nStill in love with those flourishes after all these years.",

In Sburb, the players must go through a set of tasks to escape impending doom. This song reflects the process of entering the medium. This is why I encorporated Sburban Jungle into the beginning and end. The first time Sburb is booted up you hear a bit of Sburban Jungle, just like at the beginning of the song you hear the bottom chords. Later, when John enters the medium (as well as Rose) you hear the song in more complete forms like the end of the piece. When playing, the trickiest part is definitely the triplet ostinato that continues throughout the entire song. The best method to pulling this off is by playing the note on the beat (which will always be either E flat or G) with the left hand and the rest of the notes on the right hand. You will notice that when there are lower notes, there are rests in the ostinato so that you can quickly jump down the piano.\n<i>(commentary redux)</i>\nContinuing the Homestuck homages, this piece prominently features the bassline from Michael Guy Bowman's Sburban Jungle.\nWhen I was writing this movement I really wanted to explore how much I could utilize the different registers of the piano while keeping a constant ostinato running through the middle register.",

One portion of Homestuck never focused on is the direct aftermath of the destruction of the Reckoning. Requiem is a theme for all the people and things lost on Earth. The song itself could be very tricky to play depending on how familiar you are with time signatures. The piece is in 4/4 for the majority of the first half. It enters a 5/4 section with a 4/4 continuation of the \"siren\" effect overlapping. The hemiola only occurs the first time, the second time bringing in a 5/4 melody to accompany it. Immediately afterwards the piece shifts into mixed meter. The 7/8 section is briefly interupted by an apostrophe of 5/8. The ending shifts to 6/8 as the tone shifts from minor to major.\n<i>(commentary redux)</i>\nContinuing my quest to explore rhythm and melody, Requiem's goal was to keep a melody whipping between different time signatures while not feeling jerky or sudden.\nI tried to hide the resolution at the end by having a quiet final note low in the bass after the bell like ringing of the final major arrival to add finality while also trying to let the unresolved final chord linger. Erik's performance really nailed it.",

However, the last run ends in dissonance, because we don't know how the exile's story will play out.\n<i>(commentary redux)</i>\nA really terrible engraving job on the sheet music by yours truly created a repeated note in the beginning motive that I ended up actually digging more than the original version.\nThe Meek continues the idea of bouncing between time signatures while trying to keep a sense of structure. Where Requiem was more about a constant pulse, I decided to play with elongated pauses to stretch the phrases.\nThe second section was during a time where I was really starting to love the idea of modes and modal mixture and just had fun with it. Still one of my favorite passages from the entire album!\nI also really love not resolving these movements, if you haven't noticed.",

Chronicles is a piano version of Candles and Clockwork. Candles and Clockwork in itself is a massive hemiola as each voice exists in a different time signature. The melody is adapted in this piece to match the 3/4 arpeggio. The piece keeps changing to reflect each leg of the journey the kids have to experience in order to finish the game, not necessarily in order.\n<i>(commentary redux)</i>\nChronicles is an adaption of an earlier Homestuck track I wrote, Candles and Clockwork. It was one of the first compositions I ever finished and, true to form, is a big hemiola. I wanted an ostinato in a different time signature than the melody which is what I focus on during the first section as I introduce the melody.\nThe second part of the song introduces the final major motive of the suite, a sextuplet accompaniment outlining the tonic and dominant. A staple of the western art canon, it was a good foundation for me to work on some melodies that weren't purely rhythmic noodling.",

The sirens lead into a fast paced hectic section before dying down as quickly as it appeared. A sudden destructive force that comes and goes in an instant. This song uses two motifs throughout the album: the siren and hemiolas. Measures 17-19 are more than a little tricky to play. I left a note in the sheet music to help with the ending line.\n<i>(commentary redux)</i>\nRapture was the boss tune of the suite. The big bad of the album, it brings back the bass and sustain pedal heavy ostinato while trying to juxtapose a simple and quiet melody that bookends it.",

Sburb is all about creating worlds, thus the resolution of the album comes after the storm (Rapture). No matter how harsh the process may be, the result is beauty and endless potential. This song is completely based around the hemiola motif and the origin of it. It is also designed like a day. The song starts off quiet and slow as the sun rises and slowly gets more complex and full fledged as it rises until mid day when it is most busy. As the sun sets into the later half of the day the song slows down and gets quieter toward the sunset. It resolves with the Homestuck Anthem to imply the loop to the beginning. Worlds are created and the process of Skaia starts again.\n<i>(commentary redux)</i>\nThis movement is framed as a sunset. Starting off quiet, building to a peak before shying away to where it started.\nYou can definitely see that I was influenced into writing music from the works of Philip Glass and that is in full force here, but even in retrospect I feel like I put a great personal spin on it.\nAs the sun sets, there's a final recall of the Homestuck Anthem. This movement was originally the last movement before I added the Revelations movements but it fit too well and I could not bring myself to remove it.\nI wrote this the weeks following the passing of my grandmother. It will always be for her and for everything she did for me.",

The three songs were added months after the original nine were finished and pieced together into the album. They are a standalone piece from the rest of the album but still fit the concept of Sburb and Skaia. Revelations is the equivalent of The Ultimate Riddle. Solving and understanding is the purpose behind the entire concept, however it can completely be overlooked and is not necessary to completing the rest of the process. Thousands of people can play the game and create their own universes but never quite solve the riddle. In this sense, it completely is a separate entity because the other nine songs can loop freely with or without its presence. Each of the movements is based around the same arpeggio pattern featured in Chronicles. They are another journey completely.\nThe first movement starts off as a note in the distance, a growing concept. To the sound of a siren it grows and rushes into a full blown idea. The Homestuck Anthem is briefly mentioned to imply a connection but it just keeps going leaving it in the dust. There are better things to get to. It slowly breaks down and flows into the next movement.\n<i>(commentary redux)</i>\nRevelations is a three part finale that is completely centered on the sextuplet dominant/tonic motive introduced earlier in the album. Each movement was more exploration of how I can use the same general accompaniment but completely change the melody.\n<i>(commentary from movements II and III is from original booklet)</i>",

        "commentary": "<i>Quasar Nebula:</i>\ncp_close.mp3 is a track referenced in the flash file for [[flash:338]]. an emailer sent a whole bunch of neat information about the context around this flash, so instead of rewording all that, here's their quote with all the details!\n---\nYour track listing for Dave's Phat Beat Machine, aka <a href=\"http://www.mspaintadventures.com/test_index.php?s=6&p=002238\">this page</a>, is kind of incorrect as listed in the music wiki at [[flash:338]]. Maybe you already know this stuff, but I'm breaking it down Just In Case.\nSo here's the thing: the secret buttons with extra music you find after selecting the four corner buttons on the machine are actually broken due to link rot. Somewhat unusually, the flash does indeed pull music directly from external sites which have stopped working over the years. By looking into the flash itself you can see the intended music for each button. From left to right:\n- <a href=\"http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/00253/mspa_harlequin.mp3\">http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/00253/mspa_harlequin.mp3</a><br> This one still works, as it links back to MSPA. Reused from the Act 2 walkaround, actually.\n- <a href=\"http://www.turner.com/planet/mp3/cp_close.mp3\">http://www.turner.com/planet/mp3/cp_close.mp3</a> The Captain Planet theme song, or closing credits apparently or whatever. Idk, never watched it. Visiting this link now redirects you to a redesigned Warner page instead.\n- <a href=\"http://fozzy42.com/SoundClips/Themes/Movies/Ghostbusters.mp3\">http://fozzy42.com/SoundClips/Themes/Movies/Ghostbusters.mp3</a> Ghostbusters theme song from some random-ass page that no longer exists.\n- <a href=\"http://pasko.webs.com/foreign/Aerosmith_-_I_Dont_Wanna_Miss_A_Thing.mp3\">http://pasko.webs.com/foreign/Aerosmith_-_I_Dont_Wanna_Miss_A_Thing.mp3</a> Same deal as above, but for I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing (as an Armageddon reference).... wait, that's weird. Why does that link play JOHN DO THE WINDY THING? Someone actually purchased the site domain once it expired to make it play a different song ;).\nMy point is that if you want to be accurate then you should probably be listing the music that Hussie originally put into the flash, since it's What He Intended, and omitting the replacement song, since for all we know it could be replaced any day with a medley of farts or whatever by the new site owner. As an extra I'm attaching the original tracks so you can check them out. If you want to verify you can open the flash in a decompiler program like JPEXS and check out where it links to.\n---\ni did end up keeping [[JOHN DO THE WINDY THING]] in the featured tracks list since it's what's current and has presumably been around for a while, and is a curious case of a fan track sneaking into official media (however arbitrarily so). if it gets replaced by farts and the reference list needs an update, so be it! :P",

        "commentary": "<i>James Roach:</i>\nthis track presented a unique problem in that i didn't want to write it at the time. I had written a really somber and melancholic track for the area outside the hive (the farm in the concept art) and changing it into something a little goofier and weird presented a unique difficulty for me. I just didn't know what to do for the first time in like actual YEARS i had no idea where to even start. I kept at it for a very long time and eventually just muscled through it with sheer force of will. People often ask me the hardest track or my least favorite to work on. it was this one. silver lining: its also become one of my favorites. i love how it came out. thats the power of determination. did you know you can't say determination anymore.\nthis was written for, yes, the fabled beekeeper troll that nobody will talk about. its become some sort of myth as to what happened to her but the truth isn't that exciting. in early hiveswap days each member of the crew got to \"pick\" a character that they could choose one design element of. The person who picked beekeeper just had a fantroll based off of herself. they also just... drew micro/macro porn of themselves? a power move, honestly. I met them in person and they offered me weed within literal minutes of meeting so i mean i guess they seemed nice. when they no longer worked for the company it was just simpler to redesign the character than deal with literally any of that. mystewy sowved :)\nat the point in production where they were figuring out names/personalities/traits they kinda thrust this one on me because it \"would make the most people angry.\" beekeeper troll was beloved by a very specific kind of horny dude. you know the kind that regularly says \"lewds\" or w/e. nothin wrong with that i guess. chase your bliss. but in an effort by my SO CALLED FRIENDS to antagonize me, they were like \"heh h h e h he e e he h what if we make this cute girl character that hornyboys love into a dumpy little round dude and then say we based him off james who they already do not like.\"\nthanks guys.\nanyway zebede's bullet points and even his name are references to me but thats kinda where it ends. st. james son of zebedee is also known as santiago, which is my birthname. the tongva were \"maybe\" the indigenous people of long beach, where i live, which is \"too far to visit\" which is a joke about The Greater Los Angeles Area. I live 20 minutes away. cowards.",

These things don't exactly pay well to begin with tbh, so i thought I would use the platform i've been given to try and do something... even a little positive.\nat first the song was just going to be called \"play the rain\" because naming it something stupid, while keeping up with tradition, seemed like it would be in bad taste. at some point while i was working on it i started looking into various charities i could donate the proceeds to, and it hit me that i could just ask to make the title in the credits a link to the charity.\nsuicide is something that is hard for me to talk about. its very personal. i tend to internalize feelings in order not to.. bother anyone. a few months ago i called a suicide hotline when i hit a really low point and i think just the act of calling made me feel... in charge somehow? feelings are fucked up. don't be afraid to talk to someone. even if it is a stranger at the other end of a call. take that step. you're not bad for feeling that way.\nso anyway. endless climb was one of the very first homestuck songs that really drew me in, and doing a cover of it all those years ago really got me back into taking composition seriously. it could easily be argued that this song changed my life for the better.\nif you want to know more about the trevor project, or just suicide prevention in general visit <a href=\"https://www.thetrevorproject.org/\">thetrevorproject.org</a>",

LMAO\nmusically i have jade start on bass, and as more of her friends come in she gets a little more confident in her basslines. anyway thats my fanfic.\nthis is the last new piece i'll be doing for the forseeable future, or until i feel like doing another one which might be immediately. ive been doing this on a largely volunteer basis for a while since the budget constraints were tight and we need to pay the bg and sprite artists a reasonable amount. I wanted all four kids to have music by me and i think we'll be digging into the homestuck archive for other stuff.\nanyway i hope you've enjoyed the ride! its been a little bittersweet at times for me but i'll miss posting new stuff every two weeks.",

I give my thanks to all of you for listening to my shitty music, haha.\nThis is one of my tracks for the CaNMT's almost-vaporware all-vaporwave album, CANWAVE 3. In its current iteration it's a take on 2814's sample-free approach to the vapor aesthetic through ambient and techno albums such as 新しい日の誕生 and Rain Temple. It's one of my most complex songs yet and it took a lot of work to make, but the end result is something very awe-inspiring, even to me.\n(Originally this song was a straight-up cover of Voidlight that was much more laid-back and repetitive, but I scrapped it in favor of this version. Maybe I'll upload that old version somewhere along the line.)",

        "commentary": "<i>Decon Theed:</i>\nOh boy. I feel the best way to justify this mix of the song's entire existence is with the following; the original Gold Mage had a very barren and empty arrangement, designed to facilitate a vocal track that never actually got made, and though the lack of vocals probably helped it make coloUrs & mayhem Vol. 1 in the long run, a lot of people picked up on how empty the song felt. This mix was kind of my way of making up for that, but in the process I created the opposite problem of having TOO MUCH going on, especially in that first 'verse' section. Oh dear god, that first 'verse' section; I am baffled as to how I could possibly have thought that sounded good at the time. Technically speaking the cutting and looping on that guitar sample is very well done, but it doesn't work with the vibe of the beat, and it REALLY doesn't work with the bassline. The second 'verse' isn't much better, in that itself it's a nice chilled out rework of elements from the original, but it jars with the rest of the \"GET PUMPED\" vibe the tracks got going on. Also, man oh man, Toby Fox felt the solo from the end of the original song was boring; the solo on this song is utterly lifeless. It can barely be called a solo. Ok, ok, some positives; though the chorus is somewhat cluttered, I do like how punchy the chords sound using a more typical \"rave stab\" type sound (hell, in general the synth stabs on the cut are often the better elements), the stock sawtooth bass synth actually works quite nice with the bassline, and though it gets buried in a lot of the mix, the main drum machine beat over the 'verses' and the solo is actually quite punchy, and has a real late 90s game soundtrack vibe to it that I like. The original is definitely the better version of the song in the long run, though.",

I did like 2/3 of LoFaM2 and a little bit of LoFaM3. I also made that list of references that comes up if you google \"Homestuck remix list\".\nAnyway, this is LoFaM4. It's a pretty good album with some pretty cool songs. I hope you like it. I'll be popping in to give some extra ocmmentary on songs throughout the booklet.\nI'm using the rest of this space to thank a bunch of people, starting with my collaborators. Thanks to Liza and Scott for sticking by my side for so long; to Aris, Emily, and Lathan for stepping up to judge and being awesome friends; to Makin for doing a ton to get this album out; and to Caitlin for... existing.\nI also want to give thanks to a bunch of the cool people I've met along the various communities and Skype and Discord groups. So: shoutouts to Paul, James, Nick, Luke, Marcy, RJ, Clark, Bowman, Evan, Thomas, Blueberry, Seth, Elaine, Yishan, Brad, Emilie, Christina, Paige, Ame, Lisa, Audrey, Gaby, wheals, Putnam, nights, Rune, power, Kal, Roxe, Erin, yaz, and soz. And a special shoutout to Mark.\nI think that's pretty much all I have to say? Enjoy the album.\n<i>Veritas Unae:</i>\nThis is not so much an end as a new beginning.\nHomestuck music, to me, has been an ever present part of my life for six years now. I can still keenly recall switching on my iPod Touch to the original Land of Fans and Music as I travelled into university for my first year of higher education, the excitement I felt in getting one of my own songs on the second installment and the deep pride I had in bringing the third album to fruition. The Land of Fans and Music has always been a celebration of the best of Homestuck fan music, a collection of musicians that continues to grow from strength to strength, doing things I could never dream of accomplishing.\nBut Homestuck is a work filled with passion, with creativity and ingenuity, and it is that spark that has set so many of its fans ablaze. Through transformative retellings like Cool and New Homestuck and Act 8, the songs of which have equally earned their places in the annals of fanmusic history, and innovative projects bringing light to untold stories like Beforus, Ancestral and Xenoplanetarium yet to come, Homestuck fanmusicians are always hungry for content on which to develop their musical crafts. It only takes a quick listen to some of my early Homestuck content (my tindeck is still mostly online, including those Nepetaquest tracks...) just to see how far I've been able to hone my own crafts through this medium.\nHowever, it is time. As all things inevitably must, the Land of Fans and Music project is reaching its final limits. While it would not at all surprise me to see another small scale LoFaM 5 spring forth from the incredible pool of talent that I have the privilege to interact with on a daily basis, it is here that I personally choose to bow out towards my future horizons. While I will always be a part of this fan music community, I think I'm finally tapped out on my own Homestuck energy. (Thankfully, you can be freed of my disgusting motif potpourris. How many of those do I have now? Like... 4?)\nThis album would not exist without so many incredible people. Thanks must be givven to Lambda for spearheading the project, and getting the ball rolling in the initial stages. She is incredible at pulling everything these projects need together and I know this album would not be half of what it is without her. Thanks also to Cait for what she has done towards getting this album out. Hopefully this means no more long nights for me uploading hundreds of tracks. Thanks to Blackhole and circlejourney for what they've done for the booklet you're reading right now. It looks fantastic and is filled to the brim with amazing information. And to both circlejourney and nights, thanks must be extended for the high calibre of art this booklet is home to. To Makin, Aris, Emily, Liza and even Mark and Lathan, thanks for being a part of this process in helping us sort through the hundreds of tracks we received.\nIt's been six long years for me, but I finally close my own chapter on Homestuck fan music*. I wish everyone the best of luck in their future pursuits.\nYours in fanmusic, from now and forever more,\nVeritas Unae\n*Except for Violet and Gold. If I don't finish that, I think several people would have it out for me.",

        "commentary": "<i>Lambda Bledsoe:</i>\nI'm, uh, actually not really much of a musician. I'm mostly just good at recognizing melodies. We didn't have anyone lined up to do the disc jingles (though I assumed maybe Veri would do then, as on LoFaM2+3) so I mentioned to Cait that I had the idea of making each disc a song representative of each prior LoFaM. I sent her files of myself vocalizing the melodies and she transcribed them.\nYou might be tyinking, \"wait, but there's not a song on LoFaM1 called Homestuck Title Screen\". This is correct. Its composer was unable to be contacted during its production for whatever reason, so it was arranged into both the first and last songs on the album. So, this is sort of like a reprise of the first song on the first LoFaM.\nInitially I wanted to do Emissary of Wind but Cait's idea was better.\n<i>Sozzay:</i>\nThis piece was a very unique experience for me because it involved drawing something I was rather unfamiliar with. Before I started this piece I knew from the beginning I wanted something rather dynamic and fun and I feel the result stayed true to the image I had in mind. This piece was certainly difficult, but after some trial and error things eventually started coming together nicely. I ended up having a lot of fun trying out new brushes and mixing my favourite colors together to get a final result I was very pleased with.",

        "commentary": "<i>Kouta:</i>\nAfter writing [[Denizen]], my only thought was that I really wanted to keep writing dubstep, but good dubstep. That was when I deicided to reach out to my good friend poly, who I'm a big fan of. Her dubstep is as great as her production skill, so at the time it was the perfect arrangement. It was hard working together long-distance, but we somehow made it work through all-nighter Skype calls and a lot of caffeine. The way our styles differ and yet somehow met in the middle helped make Merge exactly what I hoped it'd be.\n<i>polysaw:</i>\nProducing Merge was one of the most exciting projects I'd worked on in a long time. Kouta and I made a great team, and working with her pushed both of our boundaries well beyond our comfort zones. We got a lot of doubt from our friends about working with the caw and meow samples, but we were sure it was the perfect way to bring the song together. We were also heavy-handed with leitmotif from the original soundtrack, focusing on blending them in a way that was both interesting to listen to and recognizable. This was made with the utmost care, so give it a listen or ten.\n<i>Circlejourney:</i>\nI drew this immediately following [S] Collide. Kouta later asked to use it as the track cover for Merge on SoundCloud, and I was happy to oblige. I'm honoured that they saw it as a fitting image to accompany their (very impressive) track.",

The goal here was to make a song similar in style to Another Jungle (a very underappreciated song) without actually quoting it other than the way that song quotes Sburban Jungle. It was quite a challenge not borrowing anything else from other songs except for when I used a part of Oppa Toby Style towards the end, but this song was fun to make and I'm happy enough with the end result even if it's not as punchy as the original.\n<i>Lambda Bledsoe:</i>\na fair number of songs didn't have commentary from their musicians and/or artists, so i asked a few people, mostly mspafans managers to write some filler commentary for those. they'll be prefaced by bold names.\n<i>Quasar Nebula:</i>\n(ive gone and updated the old LoFaM commentaries to follow the same style!)\n<i><b>WHATISLOSTINTHEMINES:</b></i>\nThis art is a lovely rendition of Fitzwibble of that bit in [S] Dirk: Unite where Dirk takes Roxy and Jane along for a ride. Unfortunately, due to her foolish boorishness, Jane does not appreciate the joy of flying through the air as a bird would in spring.

It's an attempt to capture the joy I felt reading Homestuck for the first time, and a tribute to one of my favoourite things about the comic—the juxtapositions of intimately small details against cold, fathomless space.\nFrost and Clockwork is about the planets in the medium, and the things residing upon each one—hummingbirds, fireflies, cogs, falling snow. The comic discusses fate and determinism all the time, but I like to think about how it is to simply exist in this universe, without awareness of purpose or destination.\nRather than embodying a sense of mystery or adventure (as most Medium-related music tends to), I wanted this track to feel like home—something that this webcomic has become for me.\n<i>RaChoTamer:</i>\nThis was such a fun song and it reminded me of one of my favorite parts of Homestuck - the fun and adventure. It feels so welcoming and warm and triumphant, and I really tried to capture that here!",

I've resketched and redrawn this way too much since I wanted to give this very nice track some justice. Originally the idea was much more different, I was going to draw Roxy running towards Rose with Skaia in the background, but I changed it to match the canon scene better.

As you may know, the song symbolizes Prospit from A6A6A1 after it gets destroyed, so I did two scenes in one: Jane and Jake after their godtier transformations, and our heroes encountering Jack English for the first time.

All it took was a borderline distasteful amount of reverb to add a feeling of elevation, and it became Altitude. I always think of John's quest bed whenever I hear this song, probably just because it's the only really high-up point on the whole planet.\nAlso, I think the artist for this track wanted to make it have to do with John/Roxy? Which isn't really what I initially had in mind, but it's cool and it works. Death of the Author and all that.\n<i>yazshu:</i>\ni went through like fucking 5 variations of this art before i just decided to fuck it and do vaguely johnroxy retcon sequence that was at the bottom of the subreddit for some time. all of the others involved davesprite but fuck blorange. also please dont notice how lazy i was and i used the color blending tool on the tree when everything else was with the pencil tool.",

        "commentary": "<i>TirantBacon:</i>\nAs an acknowledgement, this song in many ways was mostly inspired by the tune \"Black\" By Radiation (or Toby Fox I guess). I made this song as a \"remix\" of sorts of the song called \"Midnight Suffers\", something I made for the mostly popular fanventure, cool and new web comic. If anything, I'd say it was directly copied from Black, and that I did a mostly poor effort to recreate the style... Nonetheless, I did focus on trying to incorporate some transition points in the song where it would actually deviate from the original arrangement, and I suppose it works quite well even when it's not on paper.\nThe main motif was taken from midnight suffers... A bluesy jazz type theme that was made with no real direction intended. This song is not necessarily \"catchy\", but at least it has direction and sounds good, which is always nice! Some of the most prominent instrumentation involved DVS saxophones, loud crazy drums, a heavy bassline, sharp synths and a really loud piano chord progression in the background. It's all crazy stuff.\n<i>Calicorn:</i>\nI chose Midnight as my track art, mostly just because of my love for Intermission. This song is absolutely fantastic, but since I'm not the most creative person around it took me a while to come up with any concrete designs at first. I was originally going to start off with a 50/50 bust drawing of Slick and Jack, but I soon discovered that might be a little too bland. I ended up listening to the song a dozen more times until I sketched out the base idea for the finalized idea. The main challenge had just been lining everything and getting the perspective to look pretty alright, although I'm not really an expert on perspective or composition. Either way, I'm really happy with how the piece turned out, especailly with the lighting on Slick himself.",

I really think there are parts of Cyclica that are better (if you haven't listened to Cyclica yet, you should do that; you can find the full album <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME3r64_NsnM\">on YouTube</a>). A bunch of people seemed to like Dersite, and it made it onto Cool and New Greatest Hits, so here it is I guess. The violin note holds are unrealistic, the synth is weird as fuck, the piano is bad. But everyone liked it. Except for Veri. Veri didn't like it.

The natives fight a long fight and then they just barely win! and everyone is reflecting on their loss and then she just glasses them or whatever she does. There's Crystalanthemums mostly because it seems to be teh default badass-trolls theme. Also that is some badass art.\n<i>Circlejourney:</i>\nThe prompt I received with this track was \"the Condesce (conquering planets)\". The bubbly synths and unusual harmonies called to mind a geometrical design of neons against blacks, and I thought a logo-esque look suited the rather propagandistic vibe of the title. (Am I overthinking things? Probably.)\nThe image's composition, in which the Condesce is encircled by the planets she has conquered and ruled, is inspired by the Diamond murals from Steven Universe.",

Where Condesca was a light tune with unsettling undertones, Blind Pilot goes in full force with its cinematic and emotive atmosphere, a mix of dramatic orchestra, electronic sounds and ambience. It's all in a breathtaking and impressive final result, especially considering just how silly and tongue in cheek the original The Blind Prophet was. Kudos to Kurt for recontextualizing it so well!\nAdditional note: this is the first of four Gold Pilot arranges to appear on the album, and boy does it start off the trend well.

Having two more Kanaya Maryams than Homestuck itself had is a bold creative decision, one which, in my opinion, works out rather well.

Consequently, her bright yellow eyes shine like a wild animal in the dead of night. Cool as hell all around, this image.",

This time around, the game gets completed... but maybe the ending isn't so happy, as we're reminded there's still four kids trapped in the retcon juju, waiting endlessly for freedom in paradox space.\nSome trivia: this song was named after an update discussion thread on the old MSPA forums. Apparently, that thread was in turn named after a TVTropes page. Also, alongside a Homestuck Anthem quote at the end, the music box refrain featured throughout the song quotes the foley on Homestuck's title page. That's both because it's where the retcon arms first appear, and because I always wanted to reference those windchimes. Now you know!\n<i>William Leonard:</i>\nI've always loved the 'John's retocn adventures' section of Homestuck, and I think it has to do with how it leads both the characterts and myself along a brisk rollercoaster of twists and turns, through unknown paths - this sense of adventure is what I tried to convey in this art.",

It is inspired by a lot of the new-age synthpop, which itself is inspired by the 1980s. In this time of rapid community music projects being built I want y'all to remember; we're all musicians and that is the blood that festers throughout the body. We're all alike in our different ways. love you all thanks have fun :&gt;\n<i>meigender:</i>\nFormation has a very 80's vibe to it, so I decided to aim towards more of a Hotline Miami feel for the accompanying artwork. I'm not sure how well I achieved that, but I figure a combination of bright colours and guns is at least veering in the right direction.",

When you look to the outcome of a choice, are you really seeing all that could be, or are you, by consequence of looking, only trapping yourself in the position of making that choice? You can't really see all that the future could hold. You couldn't take it, anyway.\nAt the time I wrote this song it was mostly theorizing, but it's helpd up through the years (thankfully), so I took the chance to rework and record it for this album! It was a struggle to record, and there's a thing or two I would change, but I still think 2012 me would be pretty damn proud, haha. Finished, not perfect, as they say! Homestuck did so much for me creatively. I'm glad I could be a part of this tribute.\n<i>shu:</i>\nthe track is really pretty in a melancholic and reminiscing way so I wanted to encorporate things from earlier in the comic (the tree, the hanging scalemates, and the pink flowers) into a sadder scene that's near the end? The tree's also a clever metaphor for branching paths and al that lol and also it looks cool",

He was running the fan adventure Loftlocked at the time, and I'd supplied the comic with a lot of music in conjunction with Kurtis (who is also on this album! Check him out!) Pat had approached me to write a haunting refrain for a harp playing character, Eliza. This theme would eventually form part of several songs written by Kurtis and myself, and the most prominent of which, Lamental, was made into another song, Infinity's Lament. It is a fun, jovial melody that turns darker as Eliza becomes less sure of herself and her playing. However, in a Homestuck specific context, consider Rose playing the rain, plucking strings but quickly finding herself at odds with her own land quest. Who knows? The beauty of music is that you can make your own interpretations.\n<i>Circlejourney:</i>\nThis track was initially left open to interpretation but being in contact with Veri, I asked him for a recommendation for its subject. Apparently, while Glide was oriinally composed for a fan adventure, the main motif features in a large and yet-unreleased track concerning Alt!Calliope. Veri ultimately decided that I should draw Alt!Calliope, which I was happy to, seeing as Calliope is my favourite character in Homestuck and in dire need of more fanart.\nWe've only ever seen Alt!Calliope looking extremely grim in the comic so I thought it might be a nice change if I were to depict her in a more clement mood. Imagine her soaring through space, creating and destroying galaxies. I gave her wings just so that the illustration would remain relevant to the title of the piece.",

It's a theme for alt-Calliope, as she merges her soul with Davepeta's and the other half of Gamzee's, hence the meows and the high-pitched Secret Honks in the middle section. The working title was Miss America, because it's like, the opposite of Lord English? Shoutout to whoever came up with that one on the Act 8 team. This one was suepr fun to make since I got to use a lot of wacky sampling techniques and also I just love Calliope a whole god damn lot okay.\n<i><b>ndividedbyzero:</b></i>\nLike the song, this fantastic art was originally used for Act 8 Volume 1.

This song is meant to be a theme for late-game PS, with the first half representing the over-the-top surrealism of Higgs Bonehead's sacrifice, and the second, the far more interesting rush to beat DMK. I pretty much spent the ages 10-12 listening to Daft Punk and Digitalism near-exclusively, and I think the influence shines through pretty clearly here. The second half is a slight nod to the rush of [S] Dirk: Unite and Synchronize, which I feel is stylistically similar to the pacing from the end of PS.\n<i>Elanor Pam:</i>\nThe futility of a sacrifice, the chaos of a final battle, the wrath of an arbiter, the finding of love after death, the absolute ownage of a sharply written missive. All these and more contributed to making the epic ending of Problem Sleuth what it came to be known as: a confusing clusterfuck of hilarious and completely insane shenanigans.",

It was based on the hypothetical question \"What if Rose went grimdark?\" which was based off of a series of shitposts on the /r/homestuck subreddit. With this song, I tried to make it mirror the chain of events that occur to Rose before and after she goes grimdark in the comic. It starts off relatively simple, but quickly goes ominous and unsettling as she stares into the cueball in \"Seer: Ask.\" Then suddenly the song explodes into a blistering drum-and-bass track with booming organs to tell you that, in fact, shit just got real. The song was meant to be reminiscent of \"Your Best Nightmare\" from Undertale, and I hope I was able to pull that effect off. The song concludes in much the same way it began as Rose, in her newly darkened state, flies into space. All things considered, I had a lot of fun making this song.\nThis track received brand new art for its release on LOFAM4, courtesy of the talented Neiratina! With this song portraying Rose succumbing to the broodfester throes and going Grimdark, this art features Rose beginning to slip away to the eldritch Horrorterrors as well. WIth her wand gripped firmly in hand, Rose looks fiercely determined to destroy anything in her path. Her aura of golden is inexorably being snuffed out by the black tentacles that pour out of the image, even interfering with the designs in Rose's shrit and snaking their way into the background. Marked with jagged lines and dripping ink, this piece perfectly caputres Rose's last moments of innocence as she throws caution to the wind and turns herself Grimdark.",

The piece manages to render the two lovers at their closest, while also highlighting the extremes of both of their characters. Rose's skin is tainted black to indicate her status as Grimdark, while Kanaya is glowing white as rainbow drinkers often do. Although the addition of the titular \"greensleeves\" to Kanaya's outfit is subtle, it helps tie the artwork even further to its song and turns it into an excellent companion.",

I really like the glitchy sections of Gold Pilot, and my initial plan was to slow those parts down, loop them, add drums, etc - the usual vaporwave stuff - that's also how it got its name, thanks to its project file. However once this started to happen I realized what I had written was very different, and that it had turned into some strange Gold Pilot remix. While I worked on other things for UMSPAF and CANMT, this song was on the back burner and I wasn't sure I'd actually finish it, but I stuck with it and just added things as they came to me (I'll admit that Lambda showing some interest in the song was a bit of motivation). At some point one of the later versions ended up getting accepted to LOFAM4, which was a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one, and so I wrapped up production.\nSome other facts about this song: Quite a bit of the unstrments (I'd say about 80% or so) are modifications of default Garageband synths/presets. This is the first song I've ever made that regularly causes audio overloads on my computer from just playback. The name, \"Pilotwave\" comes from when it was going to be vaporwave, I named the project file that and it sort of stuck. Special thanks goes to everyone that listened to it and helped me with balance/mastering issues, and extra special thanks to AroSoup for their amazing art!\n<i>Robin:</i>\nThis took a really long time.",

The song never did get finished for that era but stuck around until the song got made and finished in time for LOFAM4. It turns out that in the end, playing beyond the death of the king was a metaphor for the art's living past the end of the comic...\nI must confess to loving this art style, with mostly aliased lines and two-tone shading, especially in its similarity to some of Andrew Hussie's own art in Homestuck. It's none too common to see fanart of Calmasis, so it's nice to see them rendered in a more dynamic pose than the only canon one, while still clearly recognizable as that same antihero.",

        "commentary": "<i>The Great Anansi:</i>\nEn Masse is actually a remastering of sorts of the very first Homestuck remix (and just generally one of the first songs ever) that I made about five or six years ago, because this was conceptualized around when Homestuck was ending last year to be a commemoration of the webcomic that sparked so much creative energy in me and catalyzed about 99% of my current friendships. I was keen on having it be grand and sweepking—essentially, doing everything my initial remix did, except bigger and badder than ever before. To that end, I started tossing in some extra motifs and making the composition even mroe frantic than before, but I was keen on keeping the overall rhythm and classical-esque style of Scratch; it's been a very long time since the cueball-head was directly relevant, but it's important to remember that that's where so much started! The project encountered some severe snags due to various real life troubles and motivation issues, but thanks to the support of the LOFAM team, it's finally been brought to life and I'm back on my feet with bountiful motivation. I might be a bit rocky, but it's only going up from here!\n<i>SplitSuns:</i>\nThis art primarily focuses on Doc Scratch, his profile taking up most of the canvas. There's a nice contrast between the organic and textured forms of his suit and the precisely geometric shapes such as his cueball head, the triangle cutting through his chest, and the halo of squares over him. The use of recurring motifs such as pool balls, arrows, and brooms help to connect the piece further to Scratch's roots, with the peacock texturing suggesting the foreboding Felt Manor. An interesting artwork for an enigmatic character.",

Its success is still unclear, but I like it. I hope you enjoy.\n<i>Griever:</i>\nSo. Let me just say right now that nights, the one who first thought up these fantrolls and drew them up for the Strife 2 album, is top tier at character design. These guys were all really fun to draw and I'm glad that they came out as well as they did, honestly. They're all very differentiable from other fantrolls and just look really nice. Read nights' comic, <a href=\"https://oceanfalls.net/\">Oceanfalls</a>, because it is good and has nice character design/art in it too.\nThe music was rocking and good so I went for a dramatic action shot. I used Jojo as a reference for this type of shot, because of course I did (Read <a href=\"https://mspfa.com/?s=13714\">Jojostuck</a>). The background and everything about this picture is made only to look kind acool, which it sorta does. The art functions on the \"rule of cool\" so to speak, at least a little bit. There's not much to say about it, honestly. Maybe I've already rambled on more than other artista bout this, and I'm pretty much done expositing, but I'm gonna go just a little bit further with this commentary. But it won't be lal that important. Just recounting a story I remembered.\nDid you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It's a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend.",

This part of the song played when Vriska and her army prepared to face off against Lord English, and the art reflects this tense moment. Vriska stands in the middle of the chaos, with the house juju towering behind her. All of this is reflected in the eye of Lord English himself, his normally radiating visage forced into the position of eight-balls. The detail on English's eye is both very sharp and a little unsettling. So although this art mirrors previous scenes in the comic, it adds its own interseting twists to the presentation to make it an exciting and engaging image.",

I got 12 bucks on Paypal from What Pumpkin for that! Andrew Hussie bought me lunch! I got burgs with homestuck money!\nSpeaking of burgers, Crystalendofgames is a song that I made back in 2012 on a stormy, Autumn night. The power actually went out while I was making the song, even! The version you're hearing is from after I taped my broken ego back together and remade the whole damn thing. It's pretty Neat And Cool? I make cooler things now, though. Either way, I'm glad it could be a part of this wonderful Loaf Man.\nAnyways, I'm gay! Bye!\n<i>Circlejourney:</i>\nThis track has a climactic and solemn feel that, for me, seems to suggest the chillingly peaceful scenes preceding the violent turn of events in Act 7. As the quietest and yet most significant event in EoA6, I chose to depict the scene of PM and the Mayor climbing the Forge to cast the ring in, against the looming light of Skaia.\nThis is one part of a larger image formed by the covers of this, [[Ultimate Alchemy]], and [[Black Hole / White Door]].",

Personally, I sort of think of 2 and 3 as parts of one whole because they were so close in proudction and a number of songs were moved from the former to the latter.\nAlso for a lot of people, the most represenative songs of LoFaM2 would be things like [[Alphamatic Replacement]], [[CR1M1N4L, CR1M1N4L]], [[Fighting Spirit]], [[Dance-Stab-Dance]], stuff like that. As the, uh, co-head of Loaf 2 though, I sorta always felt that Jackpot was the \"most LoFaM2\" song? Not sure exactly what it was. Perhaps that it had like three remixes (two of which never made it to a LoFaM), perhaps that it was my personal #1 \"why wasn't this on coloUrs and mayhem\" song. But, anyway, yeah, we did Jackpot. It's a neat song.\n<i><b>ndividedbyzero:</b></i>\nIn my opinion, this track art perfectly fits the \"calm before the storm\" vibe of a middle before an end, like Disc 2 is before the endgame-themed Disc 3. I'll also note it looks incredibly fitting for the cover of a vinyl record, and with those bright colors and jazzy writing I'd check that hypothetical cover out the moment I saw it.",

At some point, it became clear I was going to drive it in a bit of a different direction, and then a few more directions, until I'd pretty much done a sick 360 degree spin across the musical canvas that is FL Studio. Wow that was kind of a weird metapohr? All in all, what you hear is what you get, and that's pretty much all I have to say on the matter. I don't want to take up too much of the commentary space, so I'll leave the rest of it ot Nick and... uh, well, yeah.\n<i>Nick Tucker:</i>\nI sketched out two versions of this art, the clean one and the \"meme\" one, which was more popular. And that's pretty much entirely understandable. Also, the title bar is based off the spine of a PS1 game.\n<i><b style=\"color: #2ed73a\">CALIBORN:</b></i>\n<span style=\"color: #2ed73a\">WAIT. WHO ARE THESE RIDICULOUS PEOPLE? FORGET THEM.</span>\n<span style=\"color: #2ed73a\">HERE IS WHAT REALLY MATTERS.</span>\n<center style=\"color: #2ed73a\"><b>A MESSAGE. FROM YOUR MASTER LORD.</b></center>\n<span style=\"color: #2ed73a\">BY THIS POINT. YOU HAVE ALREADY COME TO TERMS WITH THE FACT THAT \"HOMOSUCK. DIRECTOR'S CUT, OF THE YEAR EDITION\". IS BY FAR AND ABOVE. THE BEST PIECE OF ART. THAT YOU WILL EVER HAVE THE UNDESERVED PLEASURE TO EXPERIENCE, IN YOUR FLEETING MORTAL LIVES. IT IS A BEAUTIFUL MIXTURE. OF A MAGNUM'S OPUS THAT ASSUAGES THE AURAL SENSES. AND A GRAPHICAL COMPANION PIECE TO DELIGHT YOUR VISUAL WORLD.</span>\n<span style=\"color: #2ed73a\">THE SOUND OF THE MATTER. WHICH IS TO SAY THE \"SONG\". CONTAINS FIVE SECTIONS OF GLORY. OR EVEN \"ACTS\". SUBDIVIDED INTO USUALLY TWO FURTHER ACTS. THE FIRST TO REPRESENT MY VERY OWN BLOOD, SWEAT AND ARTISTIC PROCESS AS I CREATE THE LEGENDARY CHEF DE OUEVRE KNOWN AS \"HOMOSUCK\" ITSELF. AND THE SECOND TO REPRESENT THE CHAPTER OF HOMOSUCK THAT CORRESPONDS. YOU MAY NOTICE THAT WITH EACH PARTITION, THE SONG DOES NOT SIMPLY \"PROGRESS\". INSTEAD, IT EVOLVES. A TESTAMENT TO THE INCREDIBLE EVOLUTION OF MY BIOGRAPHICAL HERO'S JOURNEY. THAT I RECALLED TO YOU IN ANOTHER PLACE, AT ANOTHER TIME. I THINK WE ARE ALL IN AGREEMENT HERE. THAT THE WAY THE TWO MIRROR EACH OTHER. SO ELEGANTLY, AND SO CLEARLY. BASICALLY FUCKING RULES.</span>\n<span style=\"color: #2ed73a\">NOW. I HAVE ALREADY HEARD RUMORS, AND WHISPERS. FROM THE MYSTERIOUS AKASHIC SERVERS DEEP IN THE FURTHEST RING. VOICES THAT SAY THINGS LIKE, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE CALIBORN COULD MAKE SOMETHING THIS GOOD\". OR, \"THIS IS TOO 'AWESOME' FOR HOMOSUCK\".</span>\n<span style=\"color: #2ed73a\">FIRST OF ALL. FUCK YOU.</span>\n<span style=\"color: #2ed73a\">SECOND OF ALL THOUGH, YOU ARE SLIGHTLY COMPLETELY CORRECT. THAT MY INVOLVEMENT IN THIS PROJECT. WAS NOT A COMPLETE AND UTTER SOLO VENTURE. IN FACT. YOU MAY ALREADY BE AWARE. THAT THE ART PIECE WAS IN TRUTH MADE BY THE INCOMPARABLE [INSERT NAME I FORGOT HERE]. AND THE SONG ITSELF. WAS ESSENTIALLY COMPOSED BY THE LOVELY [INSERT WHOEVER TEH FUCK'S NAME HERE]. AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. SOMETHING LIKE. \"BUT IT'S LAZY TO GET OTHER PEOPLE TO DO YOUR WORK FOR YOU.\". OR. \"HOW COULD YOU BE SUCH A MISERABLE SELLOUT?\".</span>\n<span style=\"color: #2ed73a\">BOTH ARE EQUALLY MOOT POINTS. BECAUSE ON ONE HAND. I HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED THAT \"WHEN DOING ART. SOMETIMES IT PAYS TO CHEAT. [...] THIS CAN SAVE TIME\"<sup>1</sup>. AND ON THE OTHER HAND. WHICH IS REALLY JUST THE SAME HAND. THE DEGREE TO WHICH I SHOULD BE CREDITED FOR ALL THIS. IS PROBABLY MORE THAN YOU THINK. SURE, OTHER PEOPLE DID WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL 'THE HARD WORK'. IF YOU'RE A SHITTY BABY MORON WHO DOESN'T UNDERSTAND ART. BUT REMEMBER THAT ALL OF THIS. THE MUSIC, THE VISUALS, EVERYTHING. WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO CREATE. WITHOUT ME! IT WAS MY VISION THAT DIRECTED THIS PIECE. AND MINE ALONE.</span>\n<span style=\"color: #2ed73a\">THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED THE DIRECTOR'S CUT, BY THE WAY.</span>\n<span style=\"color: #2ed73a\">BECAUSE I'M THE FUCKING DIRECTOR.</span>\n<span style=\"color: #2ed73a\">\"WOW,\" YOU ARE SURELY NOW THINKING. FOR A WHILE YOU SIT AND PONDER. THE RAMIFICATIONS OF SUCH A STUNNING REVELATION. \"WE ARE ALL BLOWN AWAY\". \"MOST SHOCKING TWIST YET\". ETC ETC ETC. BUT REALLY, ALL OF THAT WAS JUST A SIDE NOTE. AND AN INTRODUCTION. NOW, WE BEGIN THE *TRUE* COMMENTARY. AND DELVE INTO THE PURE, RAW SOUL OF ALL OF THIS. TO SEE FURTHER INTRIGUING, ENLIGHTENING PARAGRAPHS. DESCRIBING IN EXCRUCIATING DETAIL EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THIS PIECE\"S SECTIONS. THEIR REASONING. THEIR JUSTIFICATION. AND EVEN THEIR PURPOSE. PlEASE GO AHEAD. AND SCROLL BACK FORWARD TO THE NEXT PAGE.\n<small style=\"color: #2ed73a\"><sup>1</sup> QUOTE CITED FROM \"HOMOSUCK. ACT ONE\".

THAT I WOULD JUST GIVE AWAY THE SECRETS TO MY TRADE? THE SPECIAL SAUCE TO THE GOURMET BUFFET??? NICE TRY, CHUMP. MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST \"INTERPRET\" IT YOUR OWN WAY. AS ALL ART IS SUPPOSEDLY WONT TO BE. MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF THAT. INSTEAD OF ATTEMPTING TO FUCKING STEAL THE THOUGHTS OUT OF MY BRILLIANT MIND.</span>\n<span style=\"color: #2ed73a\">AS CONSOLATION FOR COMING THIS FAR THOUGH. I WILL GIVE YOU SOMETHING ANYWAYS. A RARE GESTURE OF \"KIND NESS\". IT IS A DETAILED LIST OF THE MANY LEIT MOTIFS USED IN THE SONG. COMPLETE WITH MARKERS INDICATING THE LOCATIONS. OF THEIR TIMELY APEARANCES. BECAUSE HONESTLY. THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO INTERPRET THAT. IT'S JUST OBVIOUS FUCKING FACTS.</span>\n<span style=\"color: #2ed73a\">ENJOY YOURSELF. (WHILE YOU CAN.)

        "commentary": "<i>Ngame:</i>\nFor those not in the know, Michael Guy Bowman is one of the most iconic people associated with Homestuck. You may remember him as the composer of [[Sburban Jungle]], one of the comic's most iconic songs, the angelic voice that captivated your ears in [[How Do I Live (Bunny Back in the Box Version)]], or maybe even as the \"face of the fandom\" for his famous Homestuck videos and convention appearances.\nWhat isn't as well-known is that he's also an incredibly hilarious individual with dozens of sketch comedy videos - often featuring his equally sidesplitting friend, Scott Stutzsman - and I wanted to bring these two worlds together. With the release of Volume 10 in June, and the resulting focus on the Homestuck music team, Bowman appreciation had a resurgence in the fandom (especially one particular video, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cqZlNGBcwA\">Bowman's Credit Score</a>). I got caught up in the fervor as well, and made my first foray into music remixing to put together the first iteration of this tribute to Michael Bowman. The remix includes notable quotes or samples from every video that Michael Bowman and Scott Stutzman collaborated on, as well as many of their individual comedy videos.\nIf you liked Bowman's Homestuck stuff, love comedy videos, or were just too damn intrigued by this song to stay out of the loop, I recommend giving <a href=\"https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoOnh0MiKsmJb0CsYOTzkihMcNSl6-ruw\">the Stutzbows</a> (as I like to call their videos) a watch. Whether it's Scott singing you the jingle for his favorite breakfast cereal, Bowman informing you about his credit score (spoiler alert: it's 720), or both of them having some good, old-fashioned backyard fun, I'm certain there's something to enjoy for everyone.",

The friend who got me into Homestuck (now Alex's partner and roommate) came up with the title.

Though the idea never came to be, he made a couple songs for it, which then languished on the main tab of our organization sheet. Reading through the list of semi-abandoned songs there, I convinced him to put it on our Volume 8, so it ended up with some 8-related action. At some point, either the LOFAM judges listened to the album and felt it was a standout track, or Xoro submitted it on his own. The latter is possible since right around then was when Lambda put out an open call on /r/homestuck for song submissions. Either way, Xoro felt the song could bei mproved, so the song as presented here is an even more polished version of the v8lume one. Relistening, many of the changes jump out. Right away you can tell some of the instruments have changed. (Enemy Approaching, the Undertale song, is still an obvious compositional inspiration, even though the instrumentation being less electronic makes this version less similar in that sense.) Some of the mixing is better and more punchy, a skill that Xoro excels at. Terezi's theme opens the bridge, after which the song contains new composition. Returning to the original motifs of the song after the bridge, it continues to put a new spin on them. I never cease to be impressed by the musical improvements of my friends in the Homestuck fanmusic community. And I'm glad that in a managerial role, I can facilitate others' improvement. Let's all give Xoro a thumbsup for the great work here.",

It's not hard to see why if you listen to the track. The publicity brought it to the eyes of the LOFAM team, who were glad to add it.

Where's she going in this dream?\n<i><b>ndividedbyzero:</b></i>\nI was a bit unsure of what to associate this track with at first. Jade is a dead ringer for a daydreamer, but so was Dave before his Derse awakening, implied in the song throuhg Derse Dreamers and Atomyk, but Hiveswap's [[Old Secret]] is referenced in the song's first few seconds...\nI'm personally glad Elanor took the Hiveswap route for this song's track art, because I feel it fits the song so well even beyond Old Secret. The song invokes a calm theme for Joey, and speculation on all of the possible misadventuers she'll have that we'll soon get to see. As of this writing, Hiveswap's definitive release date of September 14th was revealed three days ago, and I hold hope it won't be delayed any longer. In the meantime, Daydream is a theme that embodies thoughts of that wait and that hope, and of course, thoughts of the game itself.",

Dirk's scateboard-riding I represented with Moshi Moshi?, a theme that's admittedly been a bit of a stickymotif for me (I've used it in way too many compositions). I like Moshi for an umber of reasons, not the least of which is the fact that it goes so well with so many things. What can I say? I like mashing themes together.\n<i><b>WHATISLOSTINTHEMINES:</b></i>\nAn illustration of the events of both [S] Dirk: Synchronize and [S] Dirk: Unite.

Given the jazz-era vibe of Problem Sleuth I decided I'd make something jazzy, and I figured it'd be nice to do a downtempo sort of theme, which I originally intended to represent the character of Godhead Pickles Inspector. With that in mind I sort of set to work trying to find a jazz chord progression that worked. After a bunch of fiddling about at the piano, the one I ended up with draws a lot from \"My Favourite Things\" and \"Nardis\", and so I worked out a melody of sorts over that in Ableton. Saxes are pretty much standard for jazz, and I picked a Rhodes soundfont over a piano owing to a distaste for the way a lot of piano patches sound. The sax solo I sequenced manually, and the accordion solo I reocrded as an improv.\n\"But,\" I hear you exclaim, \"if it's a GPI track then why isn't the track art GPI?\"\nThat's a difficult question to answer, exactly, but somewhere along the way, the track became reinterpreted as a theme for Death and the afterlife. \"But what is that figurine that Death is playing with?\", I hear you ask. That's the sort of question that invites what is oft known as a \"long story\", but a simple explanation is as follows:\nFor centuries, the bottom of the deepest seas had been shrouded in mystery and superstition. Some say it's a hostile place inhabited by the strangest creatures. Others, that it's a prison for the most dangerous outcasts. Legend has it that the only hope of ever getting out of there is a mask, that every deep sea creature has been craving for years. A mask they say, everyone is prepared to figut for, and risk their lives to possess. But the only way of ever finding out, is to go there and see for yourself.\n<i>Selan Pike:</i>\nLook, I should never be allowed to draw Bionicles.",

        "commentary": "<i>Veritas Unae:</i>\nI'm really sorry I delayed this album. I hope this is worth it.\nOriginally, when LoFaM 3 wrapped up and we were considering how LoFaM 4 could tie everything up, I approached konec0 about what should be done for the 'dance' track in that album could end up being. One of the original ideas was a song initially called 'Requiem Momentum / Moment of Dance'. Like [[Garden of Eden:garden-of-eden-part-1]] and konec0's dance tracks before it, it was going to flow between piano medleys (based around [[Requiem]] from Sburb) and high tempo dance segments. Eventually the ideas drifted towards being a love letter to all of Homestuck music, in particular, one that featured at least one song from every album. (Well... except Act 7, I have to draw lines somewhere; it's here I apologise to anyone expecting me to tackle the CaNMT discography.)\nFrom there, konec0's involvement in the fan music scene dropped somewhat, and I was still particularly excited about this idea around the time the ball actually started rolling on LoFaM 4. So I decided to try and revive the dead dance. Humorously, Requiem no longer shows up in the piece, so Dance of the Dead is a bit of a misnomer, but I think the frantic pace and thematic idea of the beta kids and the Midnight Crew jamming together in the Farthest Ring is one we can all appreciate. The choice to go with jazz for the piece is mostly due to how comfortable I feel writing for small jazz ensembles. Another funny thing to note is that I gave anything tricky or unplayable to Jade (consider some of the basslines or the double notes on flute) - she must hve pulled out her dreambot again! (Not withstandding, I think a couple of carapacians picked up some alto saxes.)\nMany thanks to all the amazing fan musicians who populated the sheet music thread back in the day. So amny of those scores were invaluable to me. Also thanks to TheOtherN on musescore for their incredible transcription of Watercolour, Alex Rosetti for the Pondsquatter MIDI, Max Wright for Gods of the New World sheet music, Nate Tronerud for the For Beforus sheet music, Tensei for the Rouge on the Rox MIDI, Circlejourney for the JUST1C3 MIDI, and Marcy for her incredible melody notating skills.\n<i>Selan Pike:</i>\nI think it makes a statement, and that statement is, \"I've been playing too much Persona 5\", or perhaps \"I hate drawing musical isntruments\"\n<hr>\n<b>References:</b>\n- Homestuck Vol. 1 - [[Showtime (Piano Refrain)]] - 00:00-00:37\n- Homestuck Vol. 2 - [[Verdancy (Bassline)]] - 00:53-01:01\n- Homestuck Vol. 3 - [[Chorale for Jaspers]] - 01:01-01:17\n- Midnight Crew: Drawing Dead - [[Tall, Dark and Loathsome]] - 01:17-01:49\n- Homestuck Vol. 4 - [[Ballad of Awakening]] - 01:25-01:49\n- Homestuck Vol. 5 - [[Versus]] - 01:41-02:05\n- Alternia - [[Skaian Summoning]] - 02:06-02:55\n- Squiddles! - [[Tangled Waltz]] - 02:23-02:55\n- The Felt - [[Omelette Sandwich]] - 02:55-03:42\n- Homestuck Vol. 6 - [[A Tender Moment]] - 03:09-03:42\n- Strife! - [[Atomic Bonsai]] - 03:27-04:00\n- AlterniaBound - [[A Fairy Battle]] - 03:47-04:00\n- Medium - [[Heat]] - 04:03-04:21\n- Mobius Trip and Hadron Kaleido - [[Beta Version]] - 04:22-04:39\n- Homestuck Vol. 7 - [[Let's All Rock the Heist]] - 04:22-04:39\n- Sburb - [[Revelations II]] - 04:39-04:56\n- The Wanderers - [[Aimless Morning Gold]] - 04:46-04:56\n- Prospit &amp; Derse - [[Core of Darkness]] - 04:56-05:27\n- Homestuck Vol. 8 - [[Escape Pod]] - 05:03-05:10\n- Song of Skaia - [[Skaian Birth]] - 05:10-05:27\n- coloUrs and mayhem: Universe A - [[Temporal Shenanigans]] - 05:18-05:27\n- coloUrs and mayhem: Universe B - [[Pendulum]] - 05:30-06:18\n- <i>:jokes:</i> - Watercolour - 05:30-06:26\n- Homestuck Vol. 9 - [[Skaianet]] - 06:26-6:58\n- Symphony Impossible to Play - [[II - Sarabande]] - 06:42-06:58\n- One Year Older - [[Underfoot]] - 06:58-07:16\n- Genesis Frog - [[Pondsquatter]] - 07:16-07:30\n- Cherubim - [[Red Sucker]] - 07:32-07:49\n- [S] Collide. - [[Oppa Toby Style]] - 07:40-07:49\n- Homestuck Vol. 10 - [[Train]] - 07:58-09:01\n- <i>:tobydog:</i> - [[Penumbra Phantasm]] - 08:20-08:38\n- Homestuck for the Holidays - [[George the Conductor]] - 09:05-09:11\n- Land of Fans and Music - [[Jack and Black Queen]] - 09:11-09:33\n- Jailbreak Vol. 1 - [[Phantom Echoes]] - 09:33-10:05\n- Tomb of the Ancestors - [[Spider8ite!!!!!!!!]] - 09:41-10:05\n- SBURB OST - [[Gods of the New World]] - 10:07-10:40\n- Land of Fans and Music 2 - [[Jade Aubade]] - 10:23-10:57\n- Land of Fans and Music 3 - [[Bathearst's Theme]] - 10:49-10:57\n- Beforus - [[For Beforus]] - 10:57-11:24\n- Stuckhome Syndrome Part 1 V1 - [[Four Kids and a Game They Play Together]] - 11:16-11:24\n- Weird Puzzle Tunes - [[Monochromatic Shenanigans]] - 11:24-11:41\n- Strife 2 - [[Rouge on the Rox]] - 11:41-11:58\n- Ancestral - [[JUST1C3 R41NS FROM 4BOV3]] - 11:56-11:21\n- Land of Fans and Music 4 - [[Daydreamer]] - 11:58-12:13\n- P[S] - [[Sburban Metro]] - 12:21-13:04",

        "commentary": "<i>Marcy Nabors:</i>\nThis song represents a lot of firsts for me. My first piece of Homestuck fan music, my first time composing for an ensemble of orchestral instruments, and the uh... second song I ever wrote in a digital audio workstation. I read Homestuck in a feverish marathon in the Fall of 2010 while taking a class about playing in a rock band and recording music (my high school was very cool). Around that time, I'd also been sequencing MIDI files in Anvil Studio (a program which was also the genesis of Bowman's MIDI experience), and had only recently discovered that Logic also had MIDI sequencing capabilities. After falling madly in love with the Homestuck soundtrack, I had an epiphany to the tune of \"holy shit, I know how to make stuff like that!\" and Atomyk Clockwyrk was thus the result. I've come a long way since then, but it's a testament to the quality of Logic Pro's stock library that I managed to make it sound this good with minimal knowledge of production. A little volume automation, slap a limiter on top (not even Logic's wonderful Adaptive Limiter? Come ON, 16-year old Marcy...), and blam, what you're hearing today is a time capsule of what I put together in December of 2010.\n<i><b>WHATISLOSTINTHEMINES:</b></i>\nDave is waiting in his land. For what? We're not quite sure. Perhaps he is simply waiting for one of the countless time loops he has employed as hsi session's time player. In any case, it can't be comfortable wearing that suit in that heat. I guess that's the price of being a c&nbsp;o&nbsp;o&nbsp;l&nbsp;k&nbsp;i&nbsp;d though.\nFun fact actually, this piece had a couple other variants before this version, which had Dave wearing different colored suits. One was white, and the other was red. However, after dazed-squid was suggested to try a green one instead, it managed to catch the eye quite very well indeed. As such, the green version stuck.",

The image of the Alpha Kids talking out their problems on cold stone slabs, in the middle of a hollow moon's core, really stuck with me. I set out to make a theme that would convey the melancholy, expansive atmosphere of that scene. The long pauses give off a sense of unsureness, while the echoing background noises bring us back to the chaos currently happening on the planet surface.\nAlso, this cryptic crypt song was partially based on Sburban Jungle and cryptically took inspiration fro Sburb OST's [[Outer Reaches]] cryptomnesially. The song does not have anything to do with crytpids. That's Quest Crypt.\n<i>sweetjegus:</i>\nThe A6A5A1x2combo is -apart from being a mouthful- a very introspective breath after a wild, high-octane sequence. My early draft for this piece featured all four alpha kids on their respective devices, but it felt too engaged, too connected. I think this song is more reflective of solitude (the solitude that comes despite being in simultaneous chat conversations with two other people), and I hoped to convey that.",

I'm not really a fan of stuff that shoves in references for the sake of shoving in references, so pretty much every reference I put in here was meant to connect ot the kids somehow. (Look fine Ruisn only has a really tangential connection to Jane but I didn't listen to Volume 9 because I'm a bad person)\nThis song was made when I was first really digging my teeth into making music, and I feel like it shows. Generally I feel like the production and instrumentation in this song has... a lot to be desired. Even so, making this taught me lots of things that I wouldn't have learned otherwise, and I'm glad I made it, even if I can't stand to listen to it.\nI tried to make another medley with this kind of format for the Cool and New Music Team recently, and it's essentially what I was trying to do with this song. (Although, with a different subject matter entirely.) You can find it on the Greatest Hits 2 album, under the name <i>Two Master Classes, A Knife Enthusiast, and A Green Dude Walk Into a Bar</i>. Yes, I know it's a shitty name.\nAfter her fantastic work on the Volume 5 Anthology, a project to supply Homestuck Volume 5 with unique art for each track, Aeritus supplied this wonderful image. Here, the alpha kids lie in rest, waiting for the future of attaining god tier. It... can't be comfortable to lie in rest on stone slabs. That must be hell on your back.",

I tried to extends the vaporwave feel beyond just slowing the song down, splicing and editing the original song in interesting ways, adding 80's style instruments, and utilizing pitchbend and other distortion effects to provide an uneasy feel. The result is something that transcends meme status and enters \"dream status,\" if you will. Actually that sounds kind of dumb.

Or maybe it's like an encore of Beatup where the DJ gives the backing track a little more flair. Either way, the fact that this song uses only the opening arpeggios of Beatdown throught its run works hella well as a lead-in to the next track, [[Airtime Assault]], which dives straight into the main melody.\nThis art reminds me of what could have been. Oh, Bro. You could have had it all. A sweet hipster ninja buddy just like you who had your back at all times, who enjoyed being with you and never fought against the blade. You could have trained him with such bullshit free discipline mixed with such terror free compassion that his genuine confidence would never let him lose again. Not even to you, the teacher, brother and father. Then you two could stand back to back while this badass music of fraternal teamwork played in the distance, complete with a backdrop of blazing sun and raging meteors. But then you just had to throw the kid off a building and make his daily life hell. Thanks for nothing, man.",

As for mixing, I had my music tutor (A semi-popular DJ) listen to the track and give their feedback. I then used this to make the overall song so much better.\n<i>Nuclear:</i>\nSo this art is for Airtime Asasult, which was originally named Dave v John, which is a boring as heck name if you want my opinion. There was one slot left for art and when I saw this posted in announcements I decided to take it. I haven't drawn John or Dave as much as I have my favorite Homestuck gals, so getting things right was a bit difficult at first. I started work on this in June and as time went by and I got more done, I was getting better with my art style. If I had went and finished this in a day, I don't think it would've looked nearly as good as it does. The idea came from me thinking about how John and Dave would battle. I figured Dave would abuse time travel and John would be able to retcon around, making for an interplanetary fight between good buddies. The top drawings of John and Dave are intended to look silly, as it's not likely they're fighting over something serious. Anyway this was really fun to do and I hope you enjoy the rest of the album and junk!\n(ps, viko told me to say johndave is canon i guess)",

Themes of predestination, weird time shit, luck being used as a weapon, a guy without the use of his legs, horses everywhere in a certain part...it's all kind of weird and interesting.

Even though this was the first one I made, it pretty clearly turned out to be one of the best, and I recently figured out why: the vibrato feature in Famitracker adds magic to everything and this one uses that feature pretty heavily. I'm not even joking, that functionality makes chiptune songs so much better.\nTitle is a reference to Tavros and Fairie: A Love Story, a trollfic that starts off funny but eventually becomes truly painful to read.\n<i><b>WHATISLOSTINTHEMINES:</b></i>\nSollux is about to get down.

Sharp-eared listeners may also note that in the call-and-response main melody, the first synth is in 4/4 time and the second synth is in triplets—just as Dave and Dirk aren't quite in perfect lockstep. I left the ending open ended and hopeful, because I feel like the final chapter on their relationship has yet to be written.\n<i><b>SplitSuns:</b></i>\nDave and Dirk's reuinion on the spires of LOTAK was serious and poignant, but not without its sillier moments. This art is a mashup and showcase of the most ironic bullshit the Striders had to offer throughout the story. Smuppets galore, their plush rumps and jutting probosices laid alongside such gems as a Game Bro magazine, an artifacted Statue of Liberty, the lovable Squarewave and Sawtooth, and SBaHJ icons including the Big Man himself. And who could forget Guy Fieri's surprise appearance, his scream frozen in place as he prepares to assume the title of the next Antichrist? But that's a story for another time.",

The End of Something Really Excellent is a song I wrote as kind of a book end, a symbolic song that encapsulates the journey all the characters went on, and kind of retells it in song format. From the beginning the kids went into Sburb (Sburban Jungle), learned the mythos of the Medium (Skies of Skaia), took upon them the mantle of heroes (Dawn of Man), explored their worlds (Doctor, Endless Climb, Atomyk Ebonpyre, Frost), did a bunch of stuff to salvage their session (Cascade), scratched their session and made a new one (Another Jungle, Even in Death), reflected on the journey they went on (Do You Remem8er Me), fought a great final batteo fr the sake of the session (Skaian Skrimish), and beat the game of Sburb (repreise of Sburban Jungle), and with it reached the end of the story. And so did the readers.\nHomestuck has been a heck of an adventure, one that I had the privilege of watching firsthand for some number of years. I am honored to be able to pay a tribute to such a beautiful thing with my comparatively small contribution to this project. A million thanks to Andrew Hussie and all the artists/musicians who put in so much work to make the comic into what it became. It truly was something really excellent.\n<i>Rebecca Peason:</i>\nThe End of Something Really Excellent brings a lot to mind. To the end of the story, to the end of the adventure, end of the game, the fighting, the dying, etc. Listening to it I thought of when The Beginning of Something Really Excellent played in comic and started there. The concepts jumped but in the end, I wanted something that speaks to the end of the harrowing journey playing this game was. What a relief it is that the fighting is over and for now can be left behind.\n<hr>\n<b>References:</b>\n- [[The Beginning of Something Really Excellent]] - 0:00-0:42, 4:00-4:20, 4:32-4:42\n- [[Sburban Jungle]] - 0:43-1:34, 4:21-4:54\n- [[Skies of Skaia]] - 1:19-1:38\n- [[Dawn of Man]] - 1:38-2:47\n- [[Doctor]] - 2:06-2:09\n- [[Endless Climb]] - 2:09-2:12\n- [[Atomyk Ebonpyre]] - 2:13-2:16\n- [[Frost]] - 2:16-2:23\n- [[Cascade (Beta)]] - 2:23-2:27\n- [[Infinity Mechanism]] - 2:27-2:29\n- [[Another Jungle]] - 2:47-3:02\n- [[Even in Death]] - 3:01-3:14\n- [[Lotus]] - 3:08-3:12\n- [[Do You Remem8er Me]] - 3:17-4:20\n- [[Skaian Skirmish]] - 3:38-4:00\n- [[Homestuck Anthem] - 4:42-4:54",

It's about the story of the cherubs: Caliborn's domination, the rise of Lord English, Calliope's isolation, and her alternate self's ultimate sacrifice. The working title was \"Damara's Descent\", and the whispers are actually edited recordings of exposition about Damara, but the theme changed pretty early on. Thanks to Lucas Haggett for performing bass on this track!\n<i>SmashCooper:</i>\nI'm really glad I had the chance to draw track art for a cherub song since Caliborn is probably one of my favorite characters in Homestuck. I tried to fill this up with as many pieces of imagery of the cherub's journeys to god tier, all framed within a beautiful clock ready to be smashed with a crowbar. Side Note: Caliborn's gun was superbly hard to draw and now I can see why Hussie used a jpg image for it as often as he could.",

I didn't want to do something based too heavily on another song (e.g. [[Emissary of Dance]], [[Garden of Eden:garden-of-eden-part-1]], [[I'm Not a Hero]], or [[Thermporia]]) and I really didn't want to do something memey/jokey (i.e. [[Theme of the Slam Jam]], [[JOHN DO THE WINDY THING]], or [[Sord:sord]]).\nThis... narrowed the pool of available songs from LoFaM3 significantly.\nWe ended up going with Starblaze because it <i>does</i> have original portions and I'm fairly sure was one of those \"universal yes\" songs among the judges.

        "commentary": "<i>Marcy Nabors:</i>\nBack in 2016 I got together with RJ Lake and James Roach to compile Homestuck Vol. 10. Everyone was pretty hyped, and there were threads in various places full of people feverishly speculating about what the tracklist would be. Much of this speculation focused on whether Toby Fox's elusive song Penumbra Phantasm would finally see release, founded on the rumor that he had agreed to finish it for the album.\nAround this time, a couple of us on the Vol. 10 project decided to have some fun with the speculation and put together a fake version of the album to \"leak\" to the fans, so we gathered a few WIPs that'd been cut from Vol. 10 and arranged them at the beginning of the album for an illusion of Authenticity™. Jamie Paige put together a bunch of awful low-effect vaporwave remixes of Homestuck songs, which we gave names to match what the fans were hoping for. Finally, as the keystone piece to tie it all together, we referenced an old Toby Fox piano recording and created a short (but hopefully convincing) song that we titled \"Penumbra Phantasm\". Christened by Toby's seal of approval and an unholy melding with a vaporwave Sunslammer monstrosity, this one-minute-and-fifty-second piece quickly became a fan favorite once the [sock?] ruse was revealed, and we promised that this \"Pseudumbra Phauxtasm\" would see an extended release on LoFaM 4.\nA year later we've completed this track, and now the latter third of the song is just a power metal cover of the Breath of the Wild theme, but that's a story for another day. Ask me sometime\n<i>Jamie Paige Stanley:</i>\n🅱️\n<i>Circlejourney:</i>\nThis is a highly stylised representation of Act 7, with Alt!Calliope creating the black hole that consumes the entire universe, and Joh nreaching for the knob of the door into the new universe. They circle around Skaia, neither pulled into ti nor escaping it, but trapped in the loop of its inscrutable machinations. This scene is set against an image of Paradox Space cracking at the edges, which also resembles a cracked disc: the final disc of Homestuck, shattering at the edges, foretelling of the destruction of the story itself.\nWhile this image wasn't originally made for Pseudumbria Phauxtasm, I think it is a fitting illustration to accompany it: this track is an expansive and beautifully-made arrangement of the elusive Penumbra Phantasm, a track that has been kept under wraps for almost as long as the end of Homestuck itself.",

In case you can't tell, this song is a parody of Time on My Side. I mostly played it straight to the original song, changing the instrumentation and adding some twists of my own. Of course, there's some jokes thrown into the mix as well, such as the Crazy Frog theme song, Waters of Nazareth, and other subtle additions. All in all, I hope you like this song! It's good enough for Tensei to say \"this is pretty good,\" so make of that what you will.\n<i>TwinBuilder:</i>\nWhen I saw that Thyme on My Fries' art was still unclaimed, I knew what I had to do. This is the result - a love letter to the song and the Flash it's parodying.\nI wanted to make the dividing line horizontal, but I couldn't get it to work, so I went with the diagonal split, which I'm happier with. I wanted the Dirks to look like a playing card - maybe the Suicide King, as it looks like they're decapitating themselves. The hardest part of this was Derse. I knew I could take the easy way out and copy some buildings, but I pushed myself to draw everything on my own. I'm glad I did; I think it's the best part of the piece. (See if you can spot some familiar faces in the crowd of carapacians!)\nOh, and thanks to Nights for finding the image of the sun for the line in the middle.",

The track features a bunch of obscure little refefernces like Skaian Voyages and Celestial Fantasia, both amazing Beatfox songs you should probably look up, and Formation, the Hadron song you've already listened to. Beatfox is a music god, and Hadron knew just how to combine all the good leitmotifs in order to make the song feel as grand and epic as humanly possible. I actually named this track, as I feel cool Homestuck quotes like \"Raise of the Conductor's Baton\" ought to be used when they fit the content (and indeed, Rose raises her wand... conductorly... in the animation mentioned above.

And if not, at least we get a couple minutes of cool blues scale noodling.\n<i>piskomil:</i>\nRadness is a rad song so it needed a rad track art and what is mroe rad than alpha dave saoring through space on unreal air? but there's also a bit of playfulness to the song which is why I added those shitty statues of liberty.

Yes there are like seven other songs on LOFAM 4 that use Gold Pilot. But I do think I did a lot with it, and this piece showcases a bunch of different things. It starts with pretty standard Gold Pilot, and then slowly grows into the subversion that is the Gunshow 2 Theme, followed by a drop. Then there's a section inspired by Of Gods and Witches, then whatever the fuck happens at 1:42. Bring back the Gold Pilot with a new beat, and then end with Formation. Dumb weird fadeout that I definitely could've improved somehow but I was lazy. I wrote -Omega- Timeline with the Game Over timeline in mind—the dark feel and the choirs peppered throughout reflect the devastation to the A2 session, the Of Gods and Witches section is somewhat of a tribute to... dead kids? And the next section is a tribute to... uh, the happiness that's gone? I don't know, come up with some meaning there yourself. Most of this piece was me going for a specific feel rather than a specific meaning. Also, the dashes in the name are more for my own amusement than anything. -ω-\n<i><b>ndividedbyzero:</b></i>\nOmega Timeline is a song about the Game Over timeline, which Terezi heavily assists in healing with a plan she formed herself. Naturally, then, it works for the art to show Terezi in the middle of her final journey in this timeline, inches away from finding her true potential. It fits the adventurous and determined nature of the song pretty well! The fact that the letter Omega is associated with Libra helps too, of course.",

Then, it evolved into a Rhapsody in Green cover, and the rest is history. While making this I had the image of the Midnight Crew's casino burning down as Spades struggles to escape, then I re-thought it over with Lord English's arrival into Jack's body, then Jake's battle against the leprechauns, until I eventually decided, \"as long as it's Felt-themed, this song isa bout it\". There are a few references to Felt-based songs in here, too. The aforementioned Rhapsody in Green, the eerie variation of English from early on in Carne Vale, the opening from Afraid of the Darko (although quite drastically rewritten for a cinematic vibe) and a hopeful piano reprise of Carne Vale as a reflection of the first defeat Jake had left the Felt with. Then it concludes with the tail-end of English, because the Felt never truly stay down.\n<i>sonotcanon:</i>\nsnowman a la mal from inception. credit to power for the concept!",

I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm satisfied with it, but seriously this took ages to get to a publishable state.\nProspitian Monody started life as a techno/ambient fusion with acoustic instruments in for fun too, which is a fancy way of saying I have no idea what genres actually mean. It also had a completely different melody. People told me the piano didn't fit so I made it synth, people told me the melody was aimless but couldn't explain why so I just rewrote it and blindly hoped, and they liked it but then production sucked again so I made it orchestral, and then the whole thing became synth instruments, which I kind afound bland but also it works well and I don't know what else to do. ANYWAY ENOUGH RAMBLING ABOUT USELESS FEEDBACK LETS GET TO THE SONG ITSELF\nA monody is essentially a dirge, except that it's not a dirge? It's dirgeish anyway. (fucking hell ost) This is like a funeral hymn for the White King, but the Dersite army is slaughtering all the Prospitians that try to mourn, so in the end the funeral ends up being held by some Dersites who aren't sympathetic to Prospit, but do respect tradition and politeness and etiquette and so on, so to compensate for it being a funeral for the enemy they make it all imposing and evil. (The Black King is too busy ending the world to notice.) You could sort of view it as a counterpart to [[Broken Dreams]] on the SBURB OST, but focusing more on Derse's triumph than on Prospit's downfall.\n<i><b>wheals:</b></i>\nJas posted a quite different original version of this art, showing a funeral procession of sorts for the king's impaled head, but replaced it with this even more impressive composition featuring a more dynamic posee and focused around a central Dersite. There was some disagreement on the discord server whether it looked better with or without the three in the top left, which ended with the tree being put in at 8% transparency.",

Yeah, it lacks originality, essentially being a simple medley, but I was more interested in making DnB-y stuff with a bunch of Homestuck motifs thrown together than composing something completely from scratch.\nI think I'm more or less satisfied with the end result, even though it hardly resembles jungle (as a music genre, not, you know, Sburban Jungle or anything).

One day, a melody popped into my head, and I started writing. At some point in the composition process I decided I might as well try to submit the song to LOFAM4, and with quite a bit of much-appreciated feedback from the judges, got it into a completed state. The biggest surprise as I was finishing up work occurred when Viko Riféo pointed out that what I had thought was the original melody throughout the song was in fact Bilions, which is a great song from the Genesis Frog album that I had embarrassingly forgotten about.\nA lot of people helped me to get this song into the state that it's in now, and I'd like to take this opportunity to thank them. Thanks to Viko Riféo and Kusoro, who both had some really great ideas on mastering and percussion that ultimately didn't make it into the final song; to Wheals for giving it a final name, and ESPECIALLY to Seijen, whose mastering amde the final product much better than I could have ever thought. And of course many, many, many thanks to Circlejourney, whose art is indescribably fitting and amazing. Finally I'd like to thank the LOFAM4 team for all their help and support, y'all are a bunch of great people and it's been an honor to have this opportunity.\n<i>Circlejourney:</i>\nThe track is clearly about the Ultimate Alchemy, which I also find it very evocative of. I took that prompt on as faithfully as I could.\nThis is one part of a larger iamge formed of the covers of this, [[Crystalendofgames]], and [[Black Hole / White Door]].",

A more accurate way of looking at it is that we are reversing into the events of tomorrow, with no real idea of what awaits us. When we look ahead, we see our past, and that informes our actions. The Maori turn of phrase, \"ka mura, ka muri\" means to walk backwards into the future.\nIn the modern classic piece of literature, \"Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff: THe Sock Ruse\", the titular Hella Jeff orchestrates an intricate plot to distract his compatriot Sweet Bro with the most unassuming of items: a pair of lost grey socks. The items in question, the socks, are lying in plain sight. However, there is an unintended turn. Sweet Bro spins off into a monologue, nay, a soliloquy as to the nature of socks and marijuana consumption. Hella Jeff did not forsee this consequence. But he does not hesitate to capitalise, fulfilling his desire nonetheless.\nThe vehicle in possession, the theme of walking backwards into the future is rendered physically manifest, with the metaphor of reversing Sweet Bro's car into a large body of water outside the companions' lakeside property. This is the point from which I drew my inspiration for my illustration. This is the now. This is the moment. Where is Hella Jeff going? He knows not. There is dramatic irony here: we, the readers and long-time followers of Dave Strider's work know full well what will unfold: nothing, ad infinitum. But Hella Jeff is living in the moment: he HAS the car. He knows not what awaits him.\nHe makes eye contact with you, slyly breaking the fourth wall. Almost... beckoning. Come with me, he says. Live for the present. Become an animal of the now.",

It's a track about Crowbar, but more specifically Crowbar's crowbar. Its long chronology goes nearly entirely under the radar, as does the smooth green mobster named after it. Think of this track as a means towards rectifying that.\nThe song was made with a particular narrative in mind, with each section of the song signifying another step in the juju's journey. Crowbar leads the Felt on Alternia, crowbar in hand. Slick steals the crowbar and opens the Felt vault, distorting spacetime. Kurloz finds the crowbar in a memory and hands it to Gamzee. The meteor reaches B2, and the crowbar is given to B2 Jack Noir. He destroys his prison, then fights some kinds and himself on top of a building. He and the crowbar are sucked into a black hole. The juju is thus brought to a dead Earth. Gamzee again hands the crowbar to his lord, Caliborn. With the crowbar in his possession, Caliborn trudges through his Sburb session, planet by planet. He builds an ensemble of loyal leprechaun people, including Crowbar himself. Finally, the crowbar is given back to Crowbar, who will later lead the Felt on Alternia. With so many diverging timelines in the intermission alone, we are left to guess whether the cycle will repeat again, or be cut off.\n<i>Griever:</i>\nYou know, the great thing about Homestuck is that a lot of panels are so iconic that Hussie more or less traces over them to make a new panel, and it still looks great, and people love him for it. And this self-referential quality extends to fanworks too. Makes my job easier.\nOh right, on another note, Crowbar's pretty sweet, I guess. Enjoy.",

You can also listen to this song on Ferkol's soundtrack.\nStarting off with simple choir alongside plucked strings, this piece builds up slightly, before letting a synthesizer take us deeper, as if we are descending onto the surface of Dirk's planet.

What was tricky was figuring out what exactly to show in the track art: what angle, what aspect of the dreambubbles, and so on. I didn't want to make the art too busy, so I went for a simpler piece that showcased one of the grander moments of the 'Roxy: Sleepwalk' flash—where the music swells as Roxy falls into that dream bubble. Pinks and purples were used cause they pop on the black, and they're nice mysterious colors.",

Final Fantasy 6 is a big inspiration for me, particularly the in-battle sprites and backgrounds. Homestuck, with its numerous great designs, seemed like it would be really fun to render in this style. When I saw Strife Mayhem on the song list I knew what I had to do--a large-scale battle with lots of characters to match an amazing battle song with lots of leitmotifs. I pulled a few elements from my previous track arts which were sort of stabs in the same direction, particularly the background from Medium and the handmaid from Maidswap. The GUI is also a bit of a reference to the previous track art for this song on Cool and New Volume 7.",

These intersecting characters united for one song, and the result is a mega-medley featuring references to songs from Homestuck, Touhou, Toby Fox's Touhou improvisations and... Undertale? Yeah! As progress of the song went along, I envisioned it perhaps being made by the Beta Kids in-universe. All their corresponding instruments are here, after all. Remember when they'd collaborate on songs and post it to each other on FreshJamz? Good times.\nFun fact: each of the happy fruits correspond to a beta kid. Really! You've got the red apple for Dave, which is fitting because it's his text color and because he loves apple juice. Then the green lime for Jade, also because of text color. The orainge is Rose, because, uh, Roxy says she's similar to Dirk who types in orange I guess? Then the last fruit is the yellow lemon which has to be for John, because... uh actually you know what, forget it.\nOk, here's another fun fact then. The title of the song is a play on the FreshJamz player which has the fruits on its interface, the Homestuck song [[Hauntjam]], actual fruit jam, and the fact that it is a song (i.e. \"jam\") about fruits. Neat!\n<i>sweetjegus:</i>\nOpen your heart to the fruity embrace of Apple Girlington! I have the fondest memories of Jade's fruit mishaps back in Act 3 and a soft spot for fun and twangy tracks, so Fruitjam was the perfect storm. Her outfit is drawn from cubewatermelon's absolutely adorable APple Girlington design, and I've kept to the Touhou art tradition of contorted angles within a dramatic flying object vortex - but updated, now, for a lurid fever dream ft. the chlorine-headed personification of an apple.\n<i><b>Lambda Bledsoe:</b></i>\nshe says lofam team but this song is mark's and my fault\n<hr>\n<b>References:</B>\n- [[Your Best Friend]] - 0:00-0:33, 2:45-2:48\n- [[Softly]] - 0:20-0:26\n- [[Fall of Fall ~ Autumnal Waterfall]] - 0:26-0:31\n- [[Safe Return]] - 0:39-0:43, 0:53-0:56\n- [[The Beginning of Something Really Excellent]] - 0:49-1:03\n- [[An Apple Disaster!!]] - 1:03-1:29\n- [[Ryuunosuke Akutagawa's \"Kappa\" ~ Candid Friend]] - 1:09-1:14\n- [[Bad Apple!!]] - 1:29-1:42\n- [[Native Faith]] - 1:52-1:55\n- [[The Primal Scene of Japan the Girl Saw]] - 2:12-2:14\n- [[Menu (Full)]] - 2:16-2:35\n- [[Sleeping Terror]] - 2:22-2:35\n- [[Homestuck Anthem]] - 2:29-2:35\n- [[Upward Movement (Dave Owns)]] - 2:35-2:38\n- [[Calamari Inkantation]] - 2:39-2:48\n- [[Feel (Alive)]] - 2:49-2:51\n- [[Hopes and Dreams]] - 2:52-2:55, 2:59-3:02\n- [[Theme]] - 2:55-2:58\n- [[September Pumpkin]] - 3:02-3:05\n- [[Theme of Eastern Story]] - 3:05-3:27\n- [[Magical Hopalong Cassidy Station]] - 3:18-3:29",

Perhaps you're wondering why someone would release a track on CaNMT, before putting it on LoFaM, but that was due to my joining LoFaM after this song was published. I worked on this song for nearly 2 months, so the production was a pretty complicated process - but at least I could finish it. It doesn't matter how long it took, what matters is that it's done. Originally, using pianos wasn't a part of my plan - the step before it was to use violins and Pavellion strings, because violin is Rose's instrument. But I couldn't pull it off so I switched to extremely romantic pianos midway through production. However, if I did take the pianos off I feel this track would've suffered a lot of pain, barring its size. In the end there really wasn't much that survived of my original image of this track, but I'm still happy with what I ended up with. Lightfall was my first song published anywhere, so you could say this is a big song for me.\nI envisioned the scene of Rose playing on LOLAR for this art as well as the song. I can't count how many timse I redrew this piece before finally getting it to look good, since I'm only a beginner at drawing scenery. I'm glad it turned out nicely in the end though. Also I gotta say, doing art for your own songs is kind of weird. :p",

I thought to myself, \"this must be what it sonds like when the Midnight Crew just jams\", and before I knew it I had a remix idea in my head. Something I've always loved about the original mix I did, poorly executed as it was, was how it took an idea we know to be so dark within the Homestuck universe and turned it into a light, relaxing, foot-tapping piece, something the Crew might have done in happier times.\n<i>Daniel McDonald:</i>\nIt's been long enough since I made this image that I don't have much that I can remember to say about this, beyond feeling like I really nailed Boxcars' face.",

I wanted to take Upward Movement and change it into something more EDM and techno, so I chopped and screwed traditional strings and mixed them into the powerful drum tracks and synths you hear in the song. I wanted to include motifs from both Dave and Nepeta as they're two halves of Davepeta's whole. I also incorporated caws and meows for the same effect. Finally, I put the Undertale track CORE in the song because of that one scene in EOA6 (you know the one.) There's an additional reference at that point if you're listening carefully! Although this song was challenging to make, I think it turned out very well in the end.\n<i>Shadok:</i>\nthis used to be a normal edit of the Upward Movement cover but greatest hits 2 happened on the cool and new music team so i decided to redo it. i experimented a lot with the shading but in the end, i kept something simple\n<img src=\"media/misc/collision-course-bonus.png\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1400\">",

But all in all, I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. The original plan was to go through the CANMT discography and pick the most iconic songs over time. If you're unfamiliar with its discography, I highly recommend you at least <a href=\"https://coolandnewwebcomic.bandcamp.com/\">go give it a glance</a>. I roughly settled on useing Cascante, Tick/Tock, Fruity Pebbles Redux, Gunshow, Rex Mille Geromius, Doctor and Penumbra Phantasm (cool and new vol V), Contra (from Cool and New Homestuck), Moshi Moshi, Final Confrontation, Unintentional Touhou, In the Beginning/Contact, Formation, Jungle #3, Muse of Nanchos, Flintstones, Gunshow 2, and of course, the RCT theme and Bowman's credit score. Shoutouts to difarem for making the \"it's between my buttocks\" vocalid for me. Revisit/Rewind, which is based heavily on Ascend, was released as the Cool and New Homestuck song for [S] Credits.\n<i><b>wheals:</b></i>\nThis art was made in like five hours on Christmas 2016 when i yelled at nights to make some John/Aradia art for Revisit/Rewind (it being based off Ascend, with its iconic John/Aradia art).

The idea was to write a piece that loosely followed the sonata form from [[Homestuck Anthem]] being the first theme and Penumbra Phantasm (via [[FantasyP]]) being the second. It's also intended as a left hand practice piece so the left hand is much busier than in most of my other work!\n<i>Sozzay:</i>\nThis idea came to me after scrapping a few rought drafts. Originally I planned for an artwork starring an original hero, but decided to change it to something involving John because his associated instrument is a piano. It was a difficult piece to draw, but I am very happy with the finished result and feel I created something really dynamic.",

When I first heard this track, back about 3 years ago, I knew I had to do the art for it. The song felt very grand and frenetic, while giving a sense of regality and awe, so I did my best to capture those feelings into the track art. I knew that I had to put in the White King as the main focus on the picture, since the song is a remix to a certain other song. There is a great emphasis on texture and desaturated colors, to help make the piece feel almost ilke a worn tapestry. I added a bloom filter to add to this effect.\n<i><b>Kal-la-kal-la:</b></i>\n<i>Musing upon the king and my brother's wreck, and upon the king my father's death before him.

    "commentary": "<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>\nMobius Trip and Hadron Kaleido, agents of Prospit and Derse. They once fought on the battlefield as their respective nemeses, only to be united by a common epiphany - the truth behind the Ultimate Riddle. Gazing upon the Skaian clouds, the secrets of the past, present, and future are now well guarded by these strange sentinels who spread enlightenment through their cryptic music and dance. Together, they hope their songs may be a beacon to all those who undertake the Riddle.\n<hr>\n<i>Is there a linear story to this album, or is it some other form of story telling?</i>\nI've seen a good handful of questions like this and I'd be glad to clear this up. This album does have characters and a story behind it, but it is not a linear story or a rock opera. It's an eponymous album by its members Mobius Trip and Hadron Kaleido.\nBack when Andrew proposed the music project in March of 2009, he made it clear that one of the things he wanted to do was create a lot of \"fake bands\" which would exist as actual musical entities within the Homestuck Universe in much the same light as the Gorillaz, the Monkees, or the Chipmunks (wow, those are all animal names). While we accomplished that somewhat with albums like \"Squiddles Singalong\", most of the concept albums have largely been musical homages to the actual characters. For example the Felt didn't \"make\" their album of the same name, the music team made it as program music.\n<i>Mobius Trip and Hadron Kaleido</i> is meant to be literally an album that Mobius and Hadron would make together. Like the Kernelsprites, they spread their knowledge of Sburb and <u>The Ultimate Riddle</u> cryptically through overtly complex riddles rendered as rock music. They have a seemingly limitless knowledge of all things in the Homestuck universe, or do they? For all their answers they don't just give anything away, they tease you with their songs.\nHoohoohoo!\n<i>How much thought did you put into connecting the album with Homestuck? Or was it just supposed to be a silly thing with a loose connection?</i>\nFrom the very beginning I wanted to make this an album for Homestuck fans, but I also wanted this to be something which could be listened to from the outside-in. My goal was to create a solid set of songs that would revisit the basic themes of Homestuck, meaning that the fans would get a whole new dimension to the world of Homestuck and listeners unfamiliar with the comic could discover listen to it and, if so intrigued, discover the entire world of MSPA to create context for the album. Think of it as the relationship between <i>House of Leaves</i> and the band Poe - there is intertextuality between the literature and music and together they create a bigger picture. Plus, you can discover them in whatever order you like.\nPersonally, I believe the album is very faithful to the basic ideas of Homestuck. All the big themes are there: time, eternity, repetition, survival, the unknown, fractals, betrayal, dreams, romance, hypnosis, pumpkins, etc. While I certainly had ideas for songs already floating around before the fake band project fell in my lap, my rule of thumb was to incorporate Homestuck any time I hit a dead-end and didn't know what to do. Plus, the process of planning the art was something that Tavia and I were working on from almost the very beginning.\n<i>how much of the instrumentation was synthesized and how much of it was organic? i'm thinking specifically of the fiddly guitar bits in forever</i>\nI play every instrument on this record, and all the ones that aren't real instruments I either played through a synthesizer or sequenced myself. All the guitar is real guitar played by myself. I did all of the singing except for some backup vocals by Tavia. About half of the bass parts are me playing an old P-Bass and the other half are some spectacularly vintage-sounding synth basses that I sequenced. While I do play drums, I was unable to use my drum set in the making of this album and instead spent an intense amount of time laying down the drum parts as the first step in making each track. Most of the performance side of the album was really quick and just involved running through the song and playing a midi keyboard run through patches.\nThe \"fiddly guitar bits\" are played on a white Epiphone Les Paul named Glinda.\n<i>Are there any intentional song similarities or specific inspirations, musically? Chain of Prospit reminds me a LOT of She Blinded Me With Science by Thomas Dolby, in a very good way.</i>\nNone of the songs are supposed to sound intentionally like any other song, but my style is informed by the groups I've listened to that I really enjoy. I can see the resemblance, but when I listen to my own music I always hear a demolition derby of every song I've ever liked. All the things I've seen posted about my music being a mix between groups like Daft Punk, David Bowie, or They Might Be Giants really satisfy me because those are most of the same things I listen to.\nI think I listened to \"She Blinded Me With Science\" a lot about five years ago. Thomas Dolby is a cool guy. I really like his soundtrack to Gate to the Mind's Eye.\n<i>Tavia Morra:</i>\n<i>Also any fun stories you can share from taking the pictures for the graphics?</i>\nFor the portrait of Hadron's face, I cobbled together my little lighting and shooting rig with the following: tripod, camera, music stand, orange extension cord, nightlight, and a chair. It was super guerrilla, if you consider shooting in the comfort of your own home guerrilla. Either way, it was actually a very pleasant photoshoot that didn't require an extensive amount of time to set up.\nOh, and I kept eating cookies during one of the photoshoots.\nThat's all I can remember at the moment. Bowman might remember more.",

        "commentary": "<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>\n“Lies With the Sea” is one of two songs based on sketches from dreams that I put on Mobius Trip and Hadron Kaleido - the other, aptly enough, is “Dawn of Man”.\nDuring the time I was initially formulating a concept for a fake band during the summer of 2010, I thought it would be interesting to do something with a nautical theme. One night as I was falling asleep, I very vividly imagined a melody and accompanying refrain “my heart so full of love”, which I sketched and eventually transformed into “my heart lies with the sea” to fit the concept. Ultimately I ditched the nautical theme for the band after Squiddles! Sing-along came out and resolved to develop the concept that became Mobius Trip and Hadron Kaleido with Tavia. However, the song was already well-developed by that point and I opted to keep it around.\nMy first sketch for that piece was actually a lot heavier - I produced a version over that summer as a demo for Andrew that featured a slow, dirge-like drum beat and an incredibly loud guitar riff that somewhat resembled the song “Grease” from the way-overrated musical of the same name. Perhaps later I’ll do some touch-ups to this “heavy” version of the song and share it, but until then I’d rather keep it to myself, being so primitively produced.\n One thing it has in common with the quicker, more lightly-produced version of the track I put out in May was a fairly strong inspiration from modern electronic acts. I drew farily heavily from the sensibilities of Gorillaz in chosing synthesizer sounds on tracks like “Rhinestone Eyes” and “El Ma&ntilde;ana” and also pretty closely studied the mix on Daft Punk’s “Something About Us”, a down tempo track I greatly admire.\n The thing that most strongly made me feel comfortable using this track on Mobius Trip and Hadron Kaleido was its inspiration from dreams and the sense that it generally echoed the thought of being swept away in a wave as mentioned in “Dawn of Man” earlier on the album. Originally I even recorded an alternate lyric to the melody of “Sburban Jungle” to open the second verse which I ditched that went as follows:\n “Down, down far below, somewhere safe/ Lost in the wave once again.”",
        "lyrics": "Lonely submarine in murky shades of blue and green<br>A silent knock on Davy Jones' door<br>Octopi and hydronauts explore unsalvaged shipwrecks caught<br>In coral reeves that span the ocean floor\nThe geothermal chemistry<br>Of vents below the deep blue sea<br>Burning on and on<br>The winking of an angler's light<br>You make this underwater flight<br>Down where there is no sun\nMy heart lies with the sea<br>My heart lies with the ocean\nMy heart lies with the sea<br>My heart lies with the ocean\nMy, the continental shelf and all its sunken wealth<br>Bones of those who walked the plank<br>The depth to which these pirates sank<br>Crushed by pressures great\nThe submarine has lost its way<br>Shall we ever make it to the bay<br>From where we once did leave?<br>A sonar ping still rings for help<br>Diffused amongst a cloud of kelp<br>Where mermaid kingdoms breathe\nMy heart lies with the sea<br>My heart lies with the ocean\nMy heart lies with the sea<br>My heart lies with the ocean\nMy heart lies with the sea<br>My heart lies with the ocean\nMy heart lies with the sea<br>My heart lies with the ocean\nMy heart lies with the sea<br>My heart lies with the ocean\nMy heart lies with the sea<br>My heart lies with the ocean",

        "name": "Time on My Side",
        "commentary": "<i>Tensei:</i>\nWith the Strife album, I deliberately left a lot of the background to the songs very ambiguous. There are no direct, obvious references as to what song corresponds to which character, though there are quite a few indications: each song uses an instrument that is typically associated with one of the kids in a pretty prominent way: whether it’s the piano lead in Heir Conditioning, the solo violin in Dance of Thorns, the bass and flute (shakuhachi, actually) in Atomic Bonsai, and of course the sampled beats and scratches in Time on my Side. I suppose the titles count as somewhat vague references to the characters as well.\nWith that said, I’m still not going to explicitly say “This song is actually a strife theme for Dave” or something like that. If Andrew chooses to interpret it as a good backdrop for a fight between Dirk and Jake, I am totally fine with that. Hell, I can totally see it working (And in fact it DID work, since the flash turned out pretty damn awesome)\nI always felt like this song was a bit of the odd man out on the album. While I definitely think Dance of Thorns and Atomic Bonsai were awesome in their own right, they also feel a lot more ‘conventional’ compared to this song.\nIn a lot of ways, this song is actually very minimalistic. The droning bassline and guitar chugs stay on the same chord for almost a full minute while the buildup is mostly done through sound effects and overlayed orchestral sounds.\nIMO, this results in giving the :53 point, where the chords finally start switching up, a much bigger impact (though the full Beatdown motif coming in probably helps too).\nSomething similar happens at 2:04 where after 30 seconds of the Black motif remaining on the same chord again, you get another switch, and everything just sounds huuuuuuge.\nAppropriately to the title, this song has a lot of weird time-shit going on. Disc scratching in and of itself can actually be treated as a nice metaphor for time manipulation (the comic itself definitely makes grateful use of it), so it’s no wonder that it’s almost omnipresent here.\nBy far the neatest thing, in my opinion, is 2:35 though. The effect you hear there is actually the ENTIRE SONG up until that point, played in reverse, and sped up so it fits in a couple of seconds. The idea is literally that it ‘scratches’ and resets the song, much in the same way as happens to the entire universe in the comic, so it can lay down a wicked wah-guitar solo over the ‘scratched’ version of the song.\nSo yes, this song travels back in time in order to make itself awesomer.\nJoking aside, this song, like most other ones I make, does also have some sneaky hidden references.\nThe guitar riff at 3:18, for example, is cribbed pretty much note for note from the Metallica song Master of Puppets (maybe this is a Dirk song after all?). The background strings at :37 have a very similar ascending chromatic pattern the intro to the James Bond theme. The high staccato strings at 1:50 are supposed to be reminiscent of the theme from Psycho, or really every slasher flick ever. (Black is associated with Jack Noir, Jack Noir likes to show people his stabs, etc.)\nThe original inspiration for this song probably comes from the least likely source imaginable. It’s not The Prodigy or Goldeneye 64 music, but actually the original score to the movie Space Jam. You probably don’t even know or remember it, but a lot of the songs have a very distinct looped hiphop beat, guitars, and orchestral stabs all over the place, much like a large portion of this song.\nSeriously, listen to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBenCP-51Qw\">this</a> from about 0:50 onward and you should hear the resemblance.\nThat aside, obviously stuff from The Prodigy’s Fat of the Land album bears some resemblance as well, especially with the cheesy bassline. I know that a few Prodigy songs have been used in the otherwise kinda shitty Charlie’s Angels movies whenever shit was about to go down, and that’s really the kind of vibe I was going for as well.",

Half an hour later forged this booger of a song. Seriously. It took half an hour to make this. Then I saw that THE HUSS posted something about a Problem Sleuth opening? So I was like damn that’s bananas I’ll show him up! (wow look at this nerd thinking he can actually make music)\nI sent it to his email and like a day later he sent one back asking about the music team. FLATTERING, IT WAS. So I was like sure sign me up g homey dog slice foo\nAnd that’s the story of how I got on the music team.\nOh wait. You just wanted Ohgodwhat.\n(ps that’s what it was called when i made it too)",

    "commentary": "<i>Elaine Wang:</i>\nSo. I'm Elaine Wang, orngjce223, electronic orange juice; and I do stuff. A lot of stuff really, like dragging a friend along on a dizzy jaunt through philosophy and moral free will in the context of Skaianet Laboratories, while writing an outline as to how to create a Rose Strider AU, while attempting to forecast whether GIF or PNG images will be readable in fifty years, while tossing around a rhythm in my head which might or might not turn into a song, while figuring out what environment variables to set in a bash shell to make it look as much like Homsetuck as possible, while doing pixel art to fill in the gaps, while cooking pasta.\n...No wait, not all at once. Or the pasta burns and I have to throw it out and start over. It is a thing that has happened more than once, sad to say. But I digress.\nI came to Homestuck via following the network of webcomic artists via those piles of links they have, \"these are some other webcomics that are cool\".\nI caught up right about [[flash:644]]\n[S] is very cool. I follow that bracketed letter like a Pied Piper, through WV: Ascend, through Rose's entrance and Dave's entrance and the Midnight Crew. I follow it through Descend (which is right around when a certain someone I was close to realize I liked Homestuck more than I did him. Oops, I guses there's a reason I identify as asexual). Idly I venture onto the forums, with fanfiction and speculation and world-building.\nThen someone called Bill Bolin doesn't want his music in the comic anymore for some reason. So something not entirely unlike this happened:\n\"Hey hey isn't that bassline going to have to be replaced?\"\n\"Yeah, we'll take care of it.\"\n\"Oops. I already made a bassline for you. Here here listen to it.\"\n\"That's nice. Now run along.\"\n\"Can I do something else maybe? Please? For later?\"\n\"Don't push your luck.\"\nThis is about when I figured out that yes, there is a thing called the music team and no, they're not accepting applications. Oh well. I just figure I'll keep making music since I started.\nAnd then I just never stop.\n<hr>\nSo this is basically how I came to want to collect this music, polish it. People tend to complain about having to take the time to download the entire fanmusic thread one song at a time - and those people probably don't really have an inkling of how much good is in fanmusic.\nThis album is a celebration of fanmusic, yes - but it's also intended as somthing to bring it to more people than would ordinarily venture onto a forum thread, several dozen pages long, in the Art Forum, in the MSPA fan forum, tucked away in a small corner of the Internet.\nSo while you're here, I'll say two things:\nFirstly, maybe there's something you think you want to do. Maybe you're not good at it, but if you like it, and you practice, and you have people to give you good critical feedback on how good you are at it, it'll become something you're good at. Ask someone who's good at something and they'll say the same thing. (There are exceptions, like six-fingred pianists and seven-foot-tall basketball players. Not often, though.)\nAnd secondly, if you don't already know what Homestuck is before this, maybe you should look. It is a tale of four children, and the beta test of a game put out by a mysterious company. It is a tale of twelve trolls, and two games that turn out to put one in danger of life and limb. It is a tale of four archagents, and a mansion run by a man with a cueball for a head. It is a tale of spirit quests and hilarious-looking weapons and data structures and self-consistent time travel and what happens when creativity is the driving force of the universe.\n<center>🎵🎵🎵</center>\nSo that's all that I want to say, really.\nEnjoy the music.\n<hr>\n<i>Special Thanks:</i>\nTo Elaine Wang (electronic orange juice/orngjce223), for initiating the project, and for writing the foreword to this booklet.\nTo Jeremy \"Solatrus\" Iamurri, for his magnificent work in mastering the album.\nTo Catboss (konec0) and melodiousDiscord, for pushing the project forward, and crafting the commentary booklet.\nTo Robert J! Lake, for giving us a spot on Homestuck Gaiden.\nTo the music team, for gifting us with a veritable smorgasboard of sound.\nTo Andrew Hussie, for authoring the nexus of sheer creative energy we call Homsetuck.\nTo anyone else who we might have forgotten, and to everyone who didn't contribute art/music/nominations, but supported the project nonetheless.\nLastly,\nThanks to everyone who listened to our music!\n<i>We hope you enjoyed the first-ever Homestuck Fanmusic Album!</i>",

Sometimes that fanmusic ends up being non-Nepetaquest related (rare!) and finds its way on to the Fanmusic thread.\nThis is not one of those songs.\nNear the start of this fanmusic album project orngjce223 asked for someone to remix MK_97's \"Homestuck Title Theme\", while incorporating more motifs from Homestuck's music. I decided sure why not? And then this song was born. So Beginnings is a remix of a remix, really. The original was a remix of \"Skies of Skaia\" - I added the motifs from \"Homestuck\" and \"Alternia\" because I felt they were representative of the kids' and the trolls' journeys respectively. I mean come on, the title is RIGHT THERE. So yeah.\nSince it was a title screen tune, I pretty much drew on what I remembered from game title screens to make it. Really, the only specific influence I can recall is that the piano part at the end was inspired by Kingdom Hearts' title screen tune (\"Dearly Beloved\"). I love that song.\nFun fact: I didn't realise for a while that \"Homestuck\" and \"Alternia\" were technically remixes themselves, making this a 3x remix-of-remix combob.",

Problem Sleuth has always held a place in my heart; with the rise of Homestuck, MSPA continues to be a beacon of awesome. I have never before been faced with such a preposterous amount of talent in any fandom, and the MSPA Community continues to grow and evolve in such a way that smashes through any \"threshold\" of artistic creativity. I am inspired, and wish to inspire.\nMy knowledge in FL Studio is limited to what I have learned over the years in tinkering with it, to be honest. As such, my composition \"Downtime\" is actually pretty simplistic from a technical standpoint; my teachers have always told me, \"the simpler, the better.\" I have always disliked this sentiment, but reluctantly I've come to understand the necessity of simplicity in my works. My sister - who wishes to be unnamed becuase \"lol, internet\" - was the mastermind behind this piece; I functioned as merely the interpreter to her excellent judgment. I was given the task of weaving Showtime and Showdown together, and my result became Downtime.\nHonestly, I never thought Downtime would receive as much attention as it has, let alone its own place in an awesome fan-music album alongside (in my opinion) better artists than myself. I'm grateful that it's well received, and I hope to continue composing - even if only to inspire those that listen.\nThanks, MSPA.",

So, I really took my time getting through it, especially Acts 1 and 2.\nBy the time I had gotten to the start of Act 4, I was a month behind in the story. However, just hearing Doctor for the first time completely blew me away, as I'm quite sure MANY fans reacted. The first thing I did? Started making a fan remix. I didn't want to work on it for too long, but I figured I should register and post what I had on the MSPA Forums. It was called a \"First Pwnst\" by Dacen, and brought the Music Team's very own Perry Sullivan (perrybob) \"to tears.\" I ended up finishing up the track about a week and a half later, but the release you hear on this album is an improved edit and remaster.\nDeep Breeze Mix turned more heads than I had expected it to, and is one of the reasons (with the other being another fan remix-turned official remix) I now am humbly and proudly on the Music Team.\nCredit to AndrewNeo of Skaia.net for the track's name.",

Some pipe and wind samples and string samples, balance the hollow against the warm.\nThe first version of the song is done within six hours of the flash revealing Jade's land. Trying to transcribe directly from Flash is kind of difficult since there is a very inconvenient pause (right-click, uncheck Play; check the box again when you want to start listening again) and no rewind.\nThen Solatrus quietly takes me aside and tells me I've latched onto the wrong melody. Oops.\nThat fixed, I started piling harmonics on top. Some more pipes, and strings, and a xylophone just to be contrary. Staccato strings are fun.\nInitially everything is piled on top, in the center. In revision for the album I pan everything back and forth. It may be noted that this song still sounds perfectly fine in mono, though.",

When we first meet her in the Hivebent act, she's an emotionless ghost who later becomes a ghost frog, then a ghost in a robot body (or a \"ghost in the shell\" :rimshot:), before making her final sea change into a cheerful fairy god with time powers (which explains the ticking and subtle reverse melodies of the song, at least). The peppy piano and melancholy backing strings and woodwinds represent these aspects of Aradia's presonality - accustomed to death, she acts as a cheery Charon for her fallen teammates. I built the piano melody (and the title) out of Alex Rosetti's \"Crystalanthemums\" because to me, ever since [[flash:2578]], the tune has been irrevocably linked to the trolls, Aradia, Terezi, and Vriska in particular. It also translated to a peppy piano melody much better than Toby Fox's \"[[psych0ruins]]\" would have.\nThis song is also an homage to Michiru Yamane's impressive body of soundtrack work for the various Castlevania games.",

Its dreamy topography sucks me in, and before I can protest I've been seated and presented with a wine list. \"Nothing but the finest fermented crude for you\", they say. Well okay. It's not particularly tasty, but it's nice to look at and has a nice finish.\nI compose a lot of music for solo instruments, not so much for electronics. When it struck me that I might like to make a tune in tribute of Homestuck, I immediately thuoght of the cobalt vistas of LOWAS. I was playing around with a new tuning at the time (I'm a huge fan of weird guitar stuff) and found that it had the most amazing capabilities for melody and harmony using nothing but Harmonics! Eventually I just hit the right notes at the right time and the piece practically wrote itself.\nI'd like to shout out to the Music Squad for being rad bros, and a super relieved thanks to Silence for helping me mix the tune.\nTuning: C G Bb F C D\n<i>melodiousDiscord:</i>\nThere, uh, isn't that much to tell about this piece. I had originally envisioned John sitting with his legs hanging over the edge or something and I have a clearer idea now of what I could have done! But this was back at the start of the project and my art skills were rusty so yeah. Very simple piece. Based off of what we see in the comic, and John.",

The overall objective was to remix the themes from the levels of Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles into music for each troll, a project that is still slowly ongoing.\nThis particular theme is for Terezi, based on the Hydrocity Zone music. I went for a jazzy remix, largely because I felt it tied in well with her prosecutioner thing. I think it's an interesting look at how my abilities have developed since I first wrote the piece - I had to make adjustments just to be satisfied putting it on this album.\n<i>catastrophicGenesis:</i>\nAs it happens, drawing giant sky neurons is incredibly fun. Ancient runined temples, not so much fun and also incredibly difficult to shade right, but there you go. I am ashamed I did not manage to work in any Sonic the Hedgehog references, though.",

I brought it up when we were trying to hash out some Troll leitmotifs and instruments for the Hivebent Radioplay (remember when that was a thing?) It was for Eridan(!) I guess I liked the idea of him pining over a giant pipe organ cause he thought that's what evil guys are supposed to do whenever they get scorned, by girls usually. I myself felt the sick sting of scorn when Dacen suggested an accordion or French horn might suit Eridan better. WELL FUCK YOU DACEN. LoWaA was the last in a series of 12 short songs I made for the Troll Planets. It was actually revealed a solid 4 or 5 months after the other 11, so I really wanted to make it stand out as the big finale of my (kind of pointless) musical excursion. I'm also lazy though so I just rehashed an old melody I had lying around. Then I threw in some rocking guitar and pounding drums and angry synths and called it a day. At some point I realized that the initial melody kind of gets lost in the balance, so I repeated it at the end all clear and pretty-like with harps and clarinets, which actually turned out to be my favourite part of the song, so yay.\nMud Fact: I wrote the second part of the melody when I was 12 and trying to play the Castlevania 4 theme by ear. I was kind of dumb when I was 12.\n<i>melodiousDiscord:</i>\nLoWaA was the first piece where I started to get creative. I saw a really cool looking LoWaA on DevArt and wanted to replicate the gothic atmosphere it created with the same color scheme. So I came up with this. A cathedralesque building in the foreground with Eridan sneaking around and a collection of other buildings in the back with Angels looking for him.",

And to me, ruins are really really awesome.\nI went into \"Ruins of Rajavihara\" with the intent of creating a piece of music one might hear in the \"ruins\" level fo a videogame; solemn and full of mystery while still sounding pretty cool and fast-paced. Rajavihara is a beautifully overgrown temple in Cambodia, and there are a lot of influences from that part of the world in the piece, from instrument choice to rhythm and tune.\nI hope this music invokes the ruins in Homestuck, from the Frog Temples to the many strange structures scattered across each Land. These are some of my favorite features in the comic, and I wanted to create something cool for them.\n<i>Mal McGannon:</i>\nThis is a slick song, and I have to say I liked it a lot when I first heard it. But it didn't ring out to me as a frog ruins song, which I feel like it might have been intended to be; instead, I got very vivid images from LOFAF in my mind. So when I 1) saw this song needed art and 2) stumbled across the fact that 2a) Rajavihara is a real place and 2b) Hussie used it as LOFAF scenery in [[flash:3001]], it was only logical that I take a picture of the real ruins (thanks Wikipedia!) and do some poor hue shifting and dodging and burning to it as \"art\".\nAlso, I drew those flowers. But that doesn't really matter. This song is what matters, and this song is really, really, really really good. So stop reading my drivel and close your eyes and soak it in!",

It was for this AU thing I was doing, in which Kanaya Maryam was a super secret spy having to break into the Big Boss Sollux's base with Karkat as an informer. That didn't pan out though, but I still managed to make this beauty. It's heavily, heavily inspired by Yoko Kanno, my favorite composer. The idea is that the first half is when she's sneaking about going through, knowing that this is important, THIS IS SERIOUS, and she can't risk it here. She stumbles upon a computer, with a typewriter as a keyboard for whatever reason, and then the alarm goes off she gets caught and the big bad chase action scene starts. I had worked on it for about a month, and I kept losing progress because of crashes, but Silence convinced me to finish it, and boy am I glad he did.\n<i>melodiousDiscord:</i>\nA nice, simple piece. Fashion in Homestuck is associated with Kanaya in my mind so I came up with the idea of Kanaya seeking to escape something, and then halfway through the song the klaxon alarm kicks in. Thus we get this piece of art.",

(I'm a big fan.) Another thing I'm a big fan of is Jit and his music, because Jit's mad talented. So when I was in the shower one morning (where I do my best thinking) and I had the idea for a Midnight Crew cover of Jit's song from The Felt, \"The Broken Clock\", I filed it away under \"future stuff to do\", because it's rare I have what I consider a good idea with regards to composition.\nSo I worked for quite a while on this: improvising on piano, listening to Drawing Dead over and over and analyzing the different styles of each instrument, writing things down, plugging them into my computer, hating it, writing new parts, adding material, cutting material, hating it more, et cetera, ad infinitum. The final result is still something I'm not completely happy with, but I think I can declare it as done as it'll ever be. So, I hope you enjoy it, and the rest of the first ever Homestuck Fan Album!\n<i>Brad Griffin:</i>\nWhen drawing this I learned that I can't draw clocks well in perspective, so I googled a clock and Photoshopped it in.

I came up with a remix that was a 20 second 8-bit loop track based on Sburban Jungle. I added the bridge and fadeout at a later time to make it nicer to listen to on its own.\n<i>melodiousDiscord:</i>\nI have always liked silhouette pieces. I knew that I wanted to draw John running. I briefly considered doing all four kids but decided against it, Sburban Jungle is John's theme after all, and the color scheme would look better with just him. From there it was a simple matter of posing him and arranging the rest of the piece. I think that this is one of the ones I am most proud of, even if it's very simple.",

My original plan was to make it a sad, slow song with the theme I'd come up with; at least that's what it sounded like it should do in my head. But when I showed the theme to people, the replies were all that it sounded piratey. So that was the new direction I decided to take, and eventually I ended up with Prince of Seas. Little bit of trivia; originally I'd named it Jack (after Jack Sparrow), but of course that wouldn't have fit into Homestuck at all... so I just modified Eridan's title.\nI'd originally written this before Eridan had any sort of theme for his character... and before he, uh, went off the deep end. So when it starts off, it's proud! It's powerful! Wwho is this Eridan you speak of? I am Dualscar, terror of the Alternian Seas, annihilator of the land-dwwellers! However, the middle section emphasizes the real him; a guy plagued by too many FEELINGS and PROBLEMS. But ha, he won't take any of THAT lying down, no sir! /explosive finale\n<i>crepusularDissembler:</i>\nThis was made using some very ancient techniques, by which I mean mspaint and a mouse. The drawing is very busy in terms of shapes and lines, so I tried to keep the palette simple.\nI intended this to have a bit of an iconic feel (note the orange halo formed by the clouds).",

I had written two remixes previously, but I didn't really spend much time on them. Looking back on this song now, all I can see are the mistakes and the naive part arrangement. At the time I remember really being excited about this. Thank you for the nomination.\n<i>Pancake-Fairy:</i>\nAll the warning siren thigns in it made me feel that a powerplant was about to explode.

Just saying this in case you accidentally clicked on this pdf and got lost.\nBut anyway, I guess I should talk about my track 'Jackie Treats'. The initial creation, or rather, remixing, of this track started - as far as I can remember - when I began messing around with one of the melodies from Liquid Negrocity, which is probably one of my favourite pieces off the Midnight Crew album.\nI created quite a neat little piano piece, which is heard at around 0:59 to 1:10. This is pretty much what helped me get into a rhythm for the song, and before I kenw it I began composing around it. It was probably towards the very end of the song, when I added the jazz organ into the piece that made me think of 'Bec Noir' having horrible thoughts concerning dog treats. So I decided to name the WIP track 'Jackie Treats' (The name kinda stuck).\nLastly, I needed to improve the intro. It was bad or something. So I decided to mix in Frost to help create a little symbolism here and there about BN and Jade's relationship.\n<i>Pancake-Fairy:</i>\nI drew the picture this way because the track was inspired by the Snausages page where Bec feels love towards Jade. In this piece he's putting his trust in Jade as she is holding said treats, meanwhile Dave is sneaking up behind him for an attack.",

I don't really have much to say about it, I was fucking around on my keyboard one day and played those chords you hear and thought \"yeah sure that sounds good\" (I have no fucking clue about chord progression or any other technical shit). I added the stuff at the beginning next because it sounded weird just jumping right into the chords. The drums are a combination of a preset that comes with Fruity Loops with a filter over it and a sampled drum loop I had lying around with some echo and reverb. The drums near the end are more samples I threw into a slicer and distorted.\nI don't really have a plan or anything when I make a song, so whatever happens kinda just happens, which is probably why I have nothing to say here. But either way I'm flattered that people even wanted me on this album so thanks for letting me join this project.\n<i>Elaine Wang:</i>\nSkaian air is Skaian air.

There isn't much else to say. It's moody and for mister Gemini.\n<i>umibouzu:</i>\nTo me, \"Moody Mister Gemini\" just screamed film noir.

Just that I tried to keep the instrumentals light and non-distracting, but still true to the original cockney pastiche.\n<i>Goatmon:</i>\nI feel like I really can't take credits for this song. The lyrics came from Something Awful, and the music is from a midi that Tynic scrounged up from somewhere. Someone at the Penny Arcade MSPA thread mentioned having seen a supercalifrag parody at Something Awful, and after Googling I found the lyrics, and decided to try my hand at it. Tynic volunteered her voice, and after she got the midi accompaniment, we bounced back and forth with it until it was the right key and speed. From there she recorded her part and I did mine, etc.\nTo this day, I don't really like listening to myself in this song, I just don't think it came out how I wanted it. That doesn't seem to matter to everyone else, though. I never imagined it could have taken off like it did, but it very quickly spread and apparently became a thing.\nI'd always hoped that I'd eventually come out with some Homestuck thing that would be well remembered by the fans.

I decided to make adaptations of Homestuck tunes for classical guitar, and they both translated surprisingly well for the most part. This particular rendition of Explore is based off the version from Descend, which is in C Minor as opposed to the A Minor of the original. Explore forever has an association with ectobiology because the scene where it plays in Descend is of Egbert sending babies onto meteors.\nFor the album, I added reverb onto the orginal, which I felt was a little too dry due to being recorded with an acoustic-electric guitar plugged directly into a mixer. I tried to make the reverb sound like somebody playing guitar in the Veil labs; whether or not I succeeded in doing so is up to the listener's ears.\n<i>tT Twigwise:</i>\nWhen I first saw the title, 'Hymn of Making Babies,' my mind appropriately jumped to our resident Ectobiologist, John. And listening to the track doesn't disappoint, either! The cover that EnnuiKing did is both a mix of sombre, almost Medieval playing, and then downright goofy John-ness at the end, and I wanted to try and get that. At first glance, this picture is a little serious and a little solemn, and then you realize... this is John Egbert that's the subject matter here, and that just makes it incredibly silly because, well, in the end, wouldn't he just go so over-the-top dramatic in this situation? Yeah. Probably.",

I composed this song entirely in Gar(b)ageBand over the course of a month in an internet-scarce interlude in my summer, not long after Volume 5 was released. Songs on that album, particularly [[Sunslammer]], were my main inspiration.\nI put the song on Tindeck once it was finished, and without linking it anywhere, I found that it had over 200 hits the next day (I'm still not sure how this happened, though I suspect MyUsernamesMud had something to do with it). Months later, it is still my best-known song, and one of my proudest musical accomplishments.\n<i>kayak:</i>\nThis was the first piece of fanmusic I had ever listened to and it blew my mind. It is the perfect music to when John fully realizes his powers and gets down to business as the Heir of Breath.

Generally in music, crystalline landscapes are given reverb laden atmospheres with bells and other instruments with a resonant sound. In this piece, I used the instrumentation of handbells, a piano, some synth string and choir background, and drum kit, the two prminent instrmuments being the piano and bells. The bells worked to set the atmosphere while piano handled melody. Then everything got doused in reverb. So much reverb. Maybe the reverb has reverb. But voila. This is one of my favorites from before I was on the music team.\n<i>catastrophicGenesis:</i>\nSo many layers, so much transparency, but I think it worked out quite well. I have to admit though, it's been a while since I saw a real music box comb and cylinder, so that was less successful. Sorry for that.",

The main influences in this case were Bach (instrument choice), the Professor Layton Theme (throughout, mainly the introduction and melody that the violin takes), [[Explore]], and The Felt album in general. The inspiration from Professor Layton, drawing from video game themes, also affected my choice to make this loop(able).\nHouse of Lalonde was always intended from the start to be the theme for some sort of home. Orginally, it was going to be for Doc Scratch's study... but the only reason that never happened was because I couldn't find the right organ sound (the kind you hear in [[Scratch]]). So, scrapping that idea, I continued to set about sculpting a theme for a sophisticated abode, and eventually reached the conclusion that it would work rather well for Rose's.

It was supposed to be like a [[Chorale for Jaspers]] but for the trolls' custodians. This was before I even knew Alternia was in the works. After hearing psych0ruins I loved those beginning arpeggios and crying effect. So when Rad mentioned the idea of having troll planet themes, I jumped at the chance of making one for Aradia. I used the beginning to Lusus' Lament and then combined it with those beginning arpeggios and the first phrases of psych0ruins.\nAradia's planet is the Land of Quartz and Melody, so I ran with the music box motif and added glockenspiel for a crystal-esque noise. The beginning section is kind of like what Sburban Jungle is to Rose. Music to add to her trying to enter the medium. There is a pause as she succeeds and enters and the mood of the music shifts completely. The second half builds more of the Quartz feel.\nThe title is because Nick thought we should have a foreign name.\n<i>umibouzu:</i>\nI picked up \"L'état de L'ambivalence\" before I knew what it was about. When I found out it was an Aradia land theme, I kind of panicked. Backgrounds and scenery are a huge weakness of mine, and I wasn't soure how to depict LOQAM without essentially copying the existing art, so I decided to focus more on Aradia herself.",

The whole time I was making it I had DJ School from Rhythm Heaven stuck in my head, which is another cutesy song about another pair of cool dudes who are also learning to scratch records. So I guess I stole that. They probably weren't brothers though on account of how one was blue and the other was a robot I think. Lemmings had an influence too, which is to say that's where I stole those high-pitched bleeps from. I didn't even think to use Beatdown for the melody until I had prety much built the rest of the song around it. I had an old midi (by Tenebrais I think) and started goofing around trying to play it out in a major key and it fit pretty well sooooo that's that story.\nAlso I have no idea what record scratching actually sounds like so I just downloaded a bunch of cheesy \"dj sound fx\" and tried to make a cool rhythm out of them. That little breakdown in the middle is supposed to be Bro playing a line and then Dave answering. Then they trade off some more. Then they both start playing at the same time, like back to back or something cool like that, and then it goes back to the main melody. Did I make that obvious enough? Maybe I should've made Bro a bit louder in the left speaker and Dave a bit louder in the right. Actually hold on I'm going to go do that.\n<i>umibouzu:</i>\nThere was pretty much no way I was not going to jump on \"Growin' Up Strider.\" I love Dave (and Bro).

It was amazing and, more relevant to this commentary, it reminded me that not only did I once have an interest in composition, I still had some music software installed.\nArmed with one synthesizer and inspired by Doc Scratch, I sat down and wrote inevitable End in one sitting. I didn't know what a scale was, I was clueless about mixing and the basics of song structure eluded me completely, but with enough trial and error it somehow came out okay.\nSeven months later, I decided to revisit Inevitable End and see if I couldn't make it a little better and a lot more deliberate. A War of One Bullet represents my everlasting journey from directionless experimentation to conscious design, and even thugh I have a long way to go it's worth stopping to listen to the singing roses now and then, becuase if you don't enjoy your work, who will?\n<i>Quirk:</i>\nThere wasn't much to this one, I'm afraid. Image search + 9mm bullet pick + Doc Scratch template + GIMP = ART.\nThat's some solid mathematics there. You can take that to the bank. The math bank.\nPlus it's a fun visual metaphor for the song title.",

The saxaphone sounded like Microsoft GS Wavetable SW Synth, so I experimented with slathering reverb on it. I came across a preset that made it sound like the saxophone in \"Audrey's Theme\" from Angelo Badalamenti's Twin Peaks score, and decided that this was the new direction I wanted for the song. Towards the end, it features tremolo picking, which I feel is my signature guitar technique since it's the only one I can pull off that sounds remotely impressive.\nThe name of the song doubles as an excellent echeladder rung name for Karkat. I picture him reaching the rung and being really confused by it until way after his Sgrub sesion, when its true meaning became apparent.\n<i>kayak:</i>\nThis song sounds like something you might tango to, so I wanted the pose to initially look like they were dancing, but then Kanaya's blood and limp frame sink in. I thought Kan's red skirt and jade blod coinciding with roses made a beautiful limited color scheme. I also didn't want too much detail to tip the moment too far into silly or somber, as it really is both at the same time.",

So I genuinely thought I was doing a rock cover of a synth-rock song and didn't mess with the instrumentation or anything else too drastically. Kinda wish I had in retrospect for differentiation's sake.\nStrangely, the guitar used to record this broke shortly after doing so, followed by a massive string of equipment failures with my studio setup, so I wasn't capable of redoing the track for this release. I blame using a seven-string for what is now apparently an eight-string's song and somehow getting cursed with horrible luck. Alas, you can't blame fictional children on an insurance claim.\n<i>melodiousDiscord:</i>\nMeGaLoVania + Rock. A potent combination when mixed! A similar yet more complex piece when compared to [[A Fashionable Escape]]. Both had characters that I cut out of the panel and edited to fit my purposes. I really do like how this one turned out though. My original draft had curtains on each side of her. I went back and cut them out though. I thought \"okay, it's metal, there should be smoke\". The lights were already in place so when I added the smoke effect I was awed by the effect it had. From there I touched things up and added Vriska's background lights. ::::)",

The original name for this piece was Homestuck Medley 1, since I planned on writing more like it before I realized what a ridiculous idea that was. (I actually got pretty far on number 2 before giving up.)\nBrad suggested that I rename it \"Growing Up,\" and I liked that title much better, since the song is reminiscent of someone (most likely John) reflecting on childhood memories, both good and bad. He also suggested names related to the four quadrants of troll romance. Before that point, I hadn't considered it, but the song could certainly be interpreted as musical representations of the auspistice, the moirail, the matesprit, and the kismesis.\nThough, admittedly, the original motivation behind the piece was to see how many stylse I could shove together and still end up with something vaguely coherent.\n<i>Cheers:</i>\nAs soon as I listened to this song, I knew I had to draw the artwork for it. To me, it clearly represented the passage from childhood to maturity that each of the kids, especially John, were forced to undergo in their short-lived session. Focusing on our favourite Friend-Leader, I attempted to capture this with an image of him turning his back on the relative safety and comforts of childhood and the watchful eye of his guardian.",

The song is a build-up to each of the four kids entering the Medium (they're being \"drawn\" into the game just as Eddie, Susannah, and Jake were drawn into Mid-World, but that's enough for now about something that isn't Homsetuck), so we start out with a slow rendition of \"Sburban Jungle\" played on the piano (John's instrument) with subsequent accompaniment by a violin (Rose's instrument). Then, here come the drums (Dave's instrument), and we kick the song into high gear when the flute and bass (both Jade's instruments) come in. There's a long period of pseudo-improv from the bass, flute, and violin before returning to the meat of the song - and a nod to the Squiddles theme (another reference to Rose) before the finale. Curiously, the order of the instruments exactly matches the order of the kids' introduction.",

Just kidding, that didn't happen. Maybe. Anyways, this song was really fun to make. I tried a lot of crazy sound-manipulation things I'd never really tried before for the breakdown and outro, and I really feel like I succeeded with them! The main theme that happens on the rhodes is really fun to play, and might become a prominent theme later...? Either way, I hope you like this song as much as I do! Much love from Kali, thank you for listening!\n<i>catastrophicGenesis:</i>\nThe window outline is taken from the Christ Church cathedral in Oxford and originally depicts St Cecilia.

Really intense drum &amp; bass plus a few orchestral and electronic touches tie it all together.\nThe origins of this song go back in the same manner as [[Joker Strife]]. Both of them evolved quite a bit since first compsing them in MIDI. What was really important for the changes in this version you hear is that it is made to sound like it belonged in Homestuck.\nSo perhaps when we see that page with our heroes fighting Jack Noir locked in conflict, we can play this song in our heads.\n<i>umibouzu:</i>\nHow do you draw something epic enough for a track with a title like \"Final Stand\"?\n<i>Pose as a team, because shit just got real.</i>",

Farewell was originally intended to accompany the scene where John discovered Mom and Dad were dead. At this point in the story it could have gone any way, so I started playing around and doing improvisations based around the Showtime theme, being a theme central to John. After messing around some more for a while I realised that a more bittersweet touch worked better though, and that instead of being used for lamenting, in my minds eye the piece seemed to fit something more akin to a goodbye, such as a scene displaying the kids and trolls parting ways.\n<i>melodiousDiscord:</i>\nThis piece is based on what I hope will happen (still). After joining forces to defeat Jack, the kids' ultimate reward is unlocked and the trolls either go back to their won world, or accompany the kids. John is the last to leave and you can see the shadows of Terezi and Karkat. John gives a final wave before stepping through the door, Karkat gives a last farewell gesture in response. A bittersweet ending indeed.",

However, one stormy winter night as I slept curled up in my cave, the spirit of a great troll came to me...\nHold on, I think I have the wrong story.\nAnyway, shortly before Christmas, a friend of mine suggested in passing that perhaps I could put my musical talents to some practical use in the context of Homestuck, which he'd recently managed to convince me to read and I'd become instantly hooked on. We tossed around a few ideas and eventually came up with the idea of stringing together the land themes of the four kids to create some sort of medley. Unfortunately it was a fairly busy time for me, with lots of projects requiring my immediate attention.\nHowever, as Christmas approached, I made the decision to inform all my clients that I would be taking time off writing music for a few weeks to \"celebrate the holidays\", which in actual fact resulted in the creation of this arrangement!\nHope you enjoy!",

Back then it was known as \"Rubric of the Guardians\", and while that was later changed, and due to management upheavals I wasn't personally involved with its development as \"Cosmic Caretakers\", I am excited for what the project has become and what these fantastic musicians have in store for us. A comprehensive Guardian album was an idea straight out of my original list of fan-album concepts circa 2015 that spawned Beforus, and now finally the dream of having themes for all of them is realized. Vava la Guardians! (V-l-G, perhaps? Or perhaps not. :P)\n<i>ndividedbyzero:</i>\nThis album dedicated to the classic fanmusic album reality of progress stalling for months, followed by the completion of half the administrative work in the final three days before release. Seriously, I wrote this afterword 1 hour before the album stream. But if you're reading this, I hope you've enjoyed every last minute of it, because I know I sure did. All our work and unwork was not in vain.\n<i>Ucklin:</i>\nPutting together the booklet for this album made me realize just how ambitious the project was. We have said goodbye to a few old faces over the long production time of the album, and some have questioned the team's motivation. However, I think it is a testament to the enduring strength of the team that we have been able to stick with this project, despite delays, until its release. I want to thank everyone who stuck by it, even when it would have been easy to write it off. It's been a long haul, but we've learned a lot about how to avoid similar delays in the future, and the team is facing the next project with renewed enthusiasm.\n<hr>\n<center>MSPA READER.</center>\n<center>IF YOU ARE READING THIS, YOU ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO LAST ONE YEAR WITHOUT UMSPAF CONTENT.</center>\n<center>YOU ARE NOW GROWN UP.

The basic seeds of this track belong to PoisonedElite, who left behind a minute-long demo of harpsichord and strings. Imagine my surprise when her MIDI was handed down to me and there were the beginnings of an electronic drum track I didn't get to hear in her exports! So the concept was set, orchestra with electronic rhythmic backing.\nMom always seemed like quite the intimidating figure to those who met her. Perpetually drunk, with an endless, seemingly vindictive collection of wizard paraphrenalia, Mom was more living myth than parental figure. While most might soften those figures over time to be more relatable, not Hussie, and not Mom! She handles a massive Sburban monster with ease, demonstrates martial arts and weapons expertise, and catches the romantic attention of Dad without so much as breaking a sweat. All I could think of putting this track together was \"classical badass.\" So here's to you, Ms. Classical Badass.\n<i>nights:</i>\nI wanted to try something new for this piece, so I went with a lineless minimal style. For the art, I wanted to draw both of Roxy's post and pre scratch selves, not just Mom Lalonde, since I adore both equally!! While working on it, I wanted to somehow connect the two versions of Roxy together with something common. Eventually, I settled on the scarves, and used them for composition and filling in blank spots in the art piece.",

I worked on this track for Dave's Bro, my original intention was to remix [[track:beatdown-strider-style]] to have a little more flair and fit better into the cool yet dangerous aura Dave's Bro put off then to have that transition into the fight with Jack Noir. My computer halfway through this process bricked so sadly we're kinda stuck with a WIP but I hope you'll like it for the concept alone.\n<i>SplitSuns:</i>\nSplitSuns here. In addition to writing my own song for this project, which you'll find 24 tracks from now, I mastered the album in general. In theory, this means making sure each song is around the same volume so you don't have to keep adjusting your headphones. However, sometimes I did some extra work just to polish things up. Like with this song, for instance: I took what Chaosvariant had finished, added some EQ to make the mix clearer, and added a small sound effect at the end to smooth things out.\n<i>ackro:</i>\ni really like how i did this one. not too much going on but i feel its good for how simple it is. drawing the meteor took a bit of work, and looking at some reference shots from descend, but it really came together, and of course the sense of scale given with bro and the meteor is very well executed id say. pretty much flawless except for the art which i couldve done better.",

Can you feel it? That sense of danger, the palpable tension in the air as the jungle trees sway in the breeze? Quick snatches of animal chatter meet your ears, the rest muffled by the dense canopy above. You grip your rifle a little tighter and adjust your hat towards what lies beyond. You have a feeling it's going to be a long hunt.\n<i>tipsy:</i>\ni accidentally listened to bec's song instead of grandpa's song (wow well done me), so i HAD to include dogs. but i wanted the image to live up to this song's title. you can see my thought process here. besides which you can see the <i>true danger</i> that grandpa must have put himself in expressed here with his lack of pants. anyway i wanted the animals to all look vaguely real, so i spent a lot of time looking up pictures of them while drawing. i was heavily inspired by hiveswap and the photo frames of grandpa in his past, and wanted to draw a silly looking hunting scenario that could fill the gaps of in your head. there's even a version with joey's comments scribbled on, though it was a bit too busy and standoutish. hope you enjoy m3l0m4ni4c's song.",

I experimented on the colors with using a couple paper-constructioney textures on it and on the backdrop. Also, the stewardess on my plane trip caught a glance of the drawing and gave me a compliment in broken English, so you know this is some certified REAL good art.",

To me, the life of Roxy's illustrious and erudite Mom - encompassing the publication of doorstepper novels, a Guy Fieri rodeo down a waterfall of blood, and death as a revolutionary at the hands of an alien empress - is the sort of capricious novel-worthy story that can only be told through battling melodies in the major pentatonic scale, 3/4 + 6/8 cross-rhythms, and soaring trumpets.\nThe primary melodic motif opens the piece on the solo violin - a rousing tune representing the character of Alpha Rose and her rebellious aspirations. The trumpet then introduces the secondary motif - that of The Thirteenth Hour, a melodic backbone representing (erroneously?*) the novels to which she devoted the greater part of her life. It rises and dips, shifting between lyrical solos, brassy full-orchestra segments, and percussive interludes. Two of Rose's motifs, Aggrieve and Endless Climb, are also briefly quoted.\nIn all, creating The Light's Rebellion was a joy and a challenge, and possibly the first and last track of its style that I'll ever do.\n*The video from which I'd heard The Thirteenth Hour featured the cover of Compacency of the Learned, leading me to associate the track with Calmasis and CotL. In retrospect it was probably more about Calliope's Calmasis-like trollsona (i.e. the thirteenth \"troll\") than Calmasis, but here we are. (Calliope is named for the muse of epics, Mom wrote epics, it works...)\n<b><i>ndividedbyzero:</i></b>\nHer hair is like the sun, rebelling against the oppressive shadow of the night sky.\nNot complacent, but sure as hell learned enough to punt you down a waterfall with stabby needles.",

I started it in March of 2017 and though most of the compositional work was completed by July of that year, I didn't finish polishing everything up until late April 2018, after many months of procrastination and tweaking. The idea of the track is simple, it's Jake's Grandmother, Jade English, writing a song for her signature eclectic bass sometime in the 80's, which you probably already knew from the title. Anyway, I wanted to make a song that you could supposedly 'play' on the eclectic bass, which meant I had to figure out what exactly the components of such an instrument were (see <a href=\"media/misc/eclectic-bass-diagram.png\">the accompanying diagram</a>). I chose the iconic Yamaha DX7 (used in tons of 80's pop) to be the keyboards of the instrument as it could make the sounds I wanted, and I had an emulation (Digital Suburban's \"Dexed\") on hand. Other instruments used in the song were Karfoyer Audio's \"Pastabass\" and \"Swagbass\" for the bass guitars themselves, as well as Full Bucket Music's \"Ragnarók\" (used to flesh out some bass frequencies at the song's peak), and some built-in GarageBand instruments (drums) and effects.\nCompositionally, I started out with the ostinato that closes [[track:rhapsody-in-green]] (Clark Powell) from the Felt album, but played in reverse, adding in an FM pad (the aforementioned DX7) and [[track:skaianet]] by Mark Hadley on the other bass guitar. The introduction section transitions into variations on [[track:verdancy-bassline]] by Kalibration, and closes the track's first half with a medley of various Jade-related songs. The second half is an original thing (though the beginning is a variation on [[track:afraid-of-the-darko]] by RJ! Lake) that I had build in complexity and intensity before dropping off to end the piece. Reference-wise, I tried to keep things centered roughly on Jade, as well as some other skaianet/felt sort of stuff that I thought fit the Alpha world and Jae's place in it, but I did end up throwing in a couple memetic references, see if you can find them both!\n<i>Jas:</i>\nGrandma Harley often wrote her grandson about the tyranny of Lord English, obviously not able to hide everything from the enemy.",

Less because it was difficult, and more because I kept getting distracted with other projects along the way. Anyway, meow.\n<b><i>SplitSuns:</i></b>\nshu delivers some impressively smooth and refined art for everyone's second-favorite cat whose name begins with a G, GCAT. They say you can tell a lot about someone from their eyes, which makes it more impressive that you can glean this cat's mischievous expression without any eyes at all. GCAT is prepared for action from its carefully positioned placement on a tree branch, ready to pounce at a ball of yarn or teleport to the spot best suited for making your life hell. Some rough glitchy effects in the background add an interesting dimension to the piece, nicely contrasting against its smooth linework. This is one art you won't want to miss, and knowing GCAT's temper, you might miss it if you blink.",

        "commentary": "<i>Ucklin:</i>\nThe idea for this song started with the transition around 2:35 to the section with [[track:hate-you]] played in a straight rhythm. I wanted to capture a feeling of dread by making that part of the song methodical and delaying the payoff of some of the notes by a beat. It would also be a stark contrast to have this straight section in solo piano right after a climactic section with plenty of instruments in a swing beat! I was inspired to incorporate a musical palette from the 30s-40s because that's when I estimate Condy took over as Betty Crocker and started doing her guardian things. In the original song, I planned for the bass to carry most of the weight with regards to rhythm, but eventually, I was persuaded to add percussion to the track after helpful feedback from a few of the organizers, and I think it helped a lot! Hate You is quoted 3 times, although the first two ended up a bit disguised by subsequent layers of instrumentation.\nWith regards to the rest of the composition, I tried to have fun! In a way this song is supposed to tell the story of The Baroness. The beginning hook and the next section portray the mask she wears as Betty Crocker upon arriving to earth, and the persona that caused her husband Colonel Sassacre to fall in love with her. That part of the story is pretty funny to me. The following section introduces the mystery of her real identity with a jazzy Hate You quote before returning to the first section, and finally the climactic transition of the song represents the death of Colonel Sassacre and the beginning of Crocker's reign of terror proper. Finally, at the very end of the song, there is a piccolo harmony which just sounds like aliens to me, possibly because it sounds a little like a theremin. I learned a lot composing this song! Thanks for listening, and I hope you enjoyed! (And thanks to nights for art more polished and gorgeous than I could hope to deserve!)\n<i>nights:</i>\nThis very nice track gave me vibes of a casual setting with the condesce, so I thought to draw her doing a mundane but fun task - baking!

Sollux's Biclops is captured right before its imminent demise as the troll's Mind Honey-induced flip out rips through the ceiling of his hive and surrounds the lusus in a multi-colored beam of energy. The meteors illuminating the night sky further illustrate the carnage present in the scene in a fashion that pops up time and time again in Homestuck proper. If only one of those meteors could break the chain around the Biclops' leg and set it free! Wait, the resulting impact would probably just kill the Biclops anyway.

Coming from a musical background that mostly consisted of writing punk songs and making bad beats, when I started on this I sort of had no idea what I was doing?? I wanted to portray this sense of grief and sadness that would shift into a big, fun declaration of hope and all that, but really what wound up happening was me rushing through the grief and sadness to get to the fun bits with the electric guitar. I even made the fun bits with some friends watching just to make sure that it truly was both big and fun! That was the good part, in my eyes. Unfortunately, I just didn't know how to properly convey the feeling I was going for, and I really didn't know how to write a song for a character. I wasn't experienced enough and I didn't have the tenacity to stick with it. That was the first version of the song I ever made.\nThat's when my dog Beethoven died. He was 15 years old, but I'd only had him for 6 of those years. He was honestly one of the sweetest dogs anyone could ask for. He was intensely loyal, loved to get loved on, and would always come back no matter how far off he ran or how deep into the woods he got. He was one of my best friends, and having this happen to me was a very large shock to my system. I'd been fortunate enough up to that point not to have any close family or friends pass on me, but Beethoven was very close family and a good boy in general. It was my first time having to grapple with the overwhelming feeling of grief that comes with the loss of a loved one, even if that loved one was a dog, and I was struggling with it. I was down and out for a while. If it had been me from a few years ago, I probably would've just laid in the dark and grieved for a long time instead of doing anything useful or trying to get over it.\nInstead of just letting myself wallow in it though, I decided to push most of those feelings into this song. I don't really get too cerebral when I work on music; most of the time I just make sure it sounds good and then I move on. With this song, though, I specifically wrote the middle portion with this smothering feeling I had weighing on me in the forefront of my mind. It was a really therapeutic experience for me and I think it reflects in the music. The portion before the guitar comes in has wonder woven into it, but it's also heavy feeling. It being so sparse contributes to this darker feeling which makes the brighter section feel more fun, whimsical, and most importantly, hopeful.\nAll in all, this was an interesting thing that I learned a lot making. It was my first time receiving real criticism on something I made and I hope people enjoy it!\n<i>artisticallyCrafty:</i>\nThe Mothergrub has always been a fascinating creature to me in Homestuck, both as a part of reproduction and as a lusus. Especially since becoming a lusus means that you give up a life in the brooding caverns for a shortened existence to care for onechild. And with the Virgin Mother Grub drawing so many parallels to the iconic Holy Virgin Mary, I decided to draw my own parallels. I wanted this peice to be symbolic in nature towards the ideas and standards of the Mothergrub. It also may be a little sacrilegious in regards to the Catholic images of the Virgin Mary, but we'll just ignore that little fact. The Virgin Mothergrub floats with the brooding caverns behind her, and her new charge sleeping peacefully nearby, alongside other eggs nearly ready to hatch into trolls that will play a game and sacrifice to create something new. <s>(we're also going to ignore the fact that i may have had an out-of-body experience while working on this piece)</s>",

I ultimately ended up working on this track alone, looking to a demo Skip made as a stylistic reference before taking it in my own direction.\nIncubating within her egg for almost her entire lifetime, Dragonmom's track describes this inchoate state: the warmth and serenity and loneliness of waiting to hatch, and the constancy of the heartbeat throughout. The gradual build and elaboration of the track mirrors the development of an embryo. Pad synths ebb and flow, swelling and lulling with the beating of the heart. The drums start out muffled, as if heard through shell and chorion, and the sound only begins to take shape towarsd the middle of the track as the riffs grow more complex.\nFeatured in Amniotic Daydream is a delicate rendition of the motif from the Redglare/Pyralspite-related track JUST1C3 R41NS FROM 4BOV3 (also by me and Skip). This version pares away the ferocity of the original and turns it into a sweet lullaby tune. Terezi's lusus, meant to become a fearsome dragon like Pyralspite, may only dream of that destiny for now - and forever.\nI'd love to thank the mods for their feedback, which truly helped me turn this track into what it is now.\n<i>ackro:</i>\nthis piece is probably the most complex one i did for the album, and i think it paid off in spades. i used a lot of elements from the scene in which terezi's dragon hatches and is immediately killed by a falling meteor, which might be one of the best looking parts in homestuck, although its hard to choose since the first half of homestuck is littered with striking imagery. oh my god just look at it. so fucking good guys. its really good.",

That's pretty neat.\nLet's talk about it shall we?\nI've always loved Vriska's various themes and tunes through the HS soundtrack's generous selection of tracks; they're nice, they're catchy, and they're just h*ckin' amazing overall. Imagine my surprise, then, when Spidermum's slot laid unclaimed on this very album, ripe for the picking. I swore on that day that I would create the catchiest distortion guitar-filled, 8-legged bop of all time.\nWhat I made instead was the track laid before you.\nI'd like to think that it's pretty snazzy and very Serket, though I have a sneaking suspicion that I may come back to this track l8er and fix it up when I actually have a clue what I'm doing. Yes, it's pretty short and it's kinda flawed in its execution, but I just hope that you can appreciate this humble nerd's first attempt at a somewhat-professional-level tune.\nYou know what? Since you've gone through all the trouble to read this here commentary, have a free concept guitar riff for this tune. <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/arcanegemini/spidermum-initial-riff/s-WaNoN\">For you it's on the house.</a>",

That's right, it's round 2 with Dyl Nye the Science Guy: Horse edition.\nHonestly I'm not entirely sure how this worked out, but I'm glad it did since horses are the bees knees.\nI said before in Arachnida Antecessor that it was my first song for this group, and technically it is (I think), but this is the one that I feel most greatly reflects my progression in skill as a musician.\nThis tune went from a slow Horschestra with awful, grotesque choir & drum samples to this lovely little equine ditty as I went from a newbie musician creating mediocre covers of songs' melodies to the only-slightly-less newbie musician writing this very commentary piece.\nAs such, this song will always fill a special horse-shaped hole in my heart.\nWhat's this? You don't want all this personal heartfelt guff? You want me to actually talk about the track? Oh alright.\nAurthor is, unequivocally, the best character in all of Homestuck. There is no possible way you can disprove this. It was pretty much high blasphemy that so few songs were made to honour him, and so I produced this offer to appease the gods and bring balance to the universe. You're welcome.\nAlso yes, that is me saying 'neigh'.\n<i>tipsy:</i>\nFor every album cover I've drawn so far, I try to make them look a little different and experiment with different styles. In this case I tried to draw a HORSE (crazy i know) and used this very painting-like flat style, and decided to put Equius's signature up, effectively making it his own painting! This went through lots of colour hue alterations and was originally a very light pink desert in a sunny sky before we settled on this darker background to make Aurthor stand out more. I like to think that Equius is simultaneously admiring his suroundings and panicking about their imminent death by sunburn.",

The scene in which Gl'bgolyb was revealed was, to me, one of the several \"holy shit\" moments of Homestuck, and instead of trying to depict the vastness of Feferi's lusus, I went for a sense of mystery and foreboding more closely matching the tone of the music, by revealing nothing but its tentacles in silhouette.\nFinding the right balance between silhouette and rendering proved one of the primary challenges of completing this piece. Too much light meant the image lost its spooky, foreboding tone; too little made it look flat. In the end I came out with something that roughly strikes that balance, though I still feel it loses some of the spookiness of the sketch.

Quite pleased with the middle section; the cycle of dominant sevenths with the electric piano improvisation atop it.\nGrief is a strange thing and I find it rarely conveyed well in music. Another for the bonfire pile.\n<b><i>Ephemerald:</i></b>\n*The sound of a camera flash can be audibly heard over the music.* Yep. That one's going in my Pietà compilation. But really, is there a more appropriate parallel to make? Probably not. The parable of the Sufferer is full of religious iconography by design, which I guess means that Earth based the Bible off of it, and not the other way around? I don't know. I'll leave that commentary for Hussie, when he (doesn't) get around to it. As a side note, I love the \"halos\" surrounding the Dolorosa and the Sufferer here. Good stuff.",

Scratch has always been one of my favorite characters in Homestuck. When I read through the comic for the first time I loved how he orchestrated the destruction of two entire universes but managed to give an air of dignity and style to such a nefarious event. His demeanor was never overtly evil: it was unsettling at times, sure, but he always acted the part of an excellent host through and through. I tried to represent this atmosphere in my own song. Its jazzy feel ripped from \"Drawing Dead\" or \"The Felt\" definitely brings to mind a comfortable stay in Scratch's parlor, but if you listen closely you can notice sinister undertones lurking beneath the surface through the decaying bells and whistling winds. Of course, I had to throw in some reverse piano in the mix as well. It wouldn't be a Felt-centric song without one. Towards the end of the track the piano backmasks some iconic Beta Kid motifs, showing how Scratch is acutely aware of every piece to his puzzle (even when we're not). What kind of an excellent host would he be if he didn't keep tabs on his \"guests\", after all?\n<i>Ephemerald:</i>\nSo! The Puppet Master. The laid-back yet sinister vibe this song gives off felt fitting for Scratch, who, for most of the comic, just creepily stands and watches things happen. That's why I decided to not have Scratch do some Cool Actiony Villain Pose - he's a puppetmaster. He just needs to lounge.

        "commentary": "<i>ndividedbyzero:</i>\nThis track originates from an idea I had in 2014 to make a track about Calliope and Caliborn's parents. Five years later, it's finally done, stitched together from the composition and/or actual studio clips of like 4 FLPs (I went through about 6, in all). Funnily enough, the scribbles I had for this song in 2014 then are completely different composition-wise from what ended up being made, but the narrative loosely remains in this track: the cherubs' mother drifts through space, searching for her mate. She spots him, taking off at full speed, following him as he leaves a trail of destruction across the universe. Their eventual meeting is tense, cold. Saying nothing, they transform into unfathomable astral serpents, and battle to create the most innocent muse and most shitheaded gremlin to ever exist.\nI attribute the latter half of this track to listening to a lot of Hawaii: Part II, which is also sampled at the end. Listen to Hawaii: Part II.\n<b><i>Ephemerald:</i></b>",

    "commentary": "<i>Alex Rosetti:</i>\nI’m uploading the commentary for Genesis Frog as text for those of you who could not buy my album but were interested in a composer’s thoughts and detailed descriptions on its concept and execution. This is Part 1 of 4. If you like the album I encourage you to purchase it if you are able, as it helps support me and it will be that much easier to bring you more music in the future!\n<hr>\nI, Alex Rosetti, intend to make this a pleasurable experience for those of you looking for additional insight on the long-winded and self-absorbed music of this album. I assure you the commentary will encapsulate those qualities as well, perhaps even more so!\nSo, what’s this all about?\nGenesis Frog is an album about the eponymous amphibian’s journey from paradox slime to universe. Specifically, it is about the frog Jade Harley attempts to breed and grow so that He may reach His pond in Skaia and fulfill His role as the next universe created by SBURB. Some themes of the album also address the Genesis Frog that Earth already inhabits, while still other themes could be applied to any Genesis Frog in paradox space. In more general terms, it is an album about Sburb’s mythology, which is both and remarkable and hilariously ridiculous in its ability to tailor fit itself into each unique session it is in.\nWhen I first envisioned Genesis Frog, I did not imagine the album’s focus would be on a single entity from Homestuck. In fact, my first idea was to create a sort of “Homestuck Bestiary” soundtrack, giving themes to all the creatures and citizens of Sburb. The seeds of the album’s current form were planted when I decided I wanted to make a “Frogs” theme at the beginning and transform it into “Bilious Slick’s Theme” by the end of the album, thus symbolizing the overarching purpose of Sburb. I gradually fell more in love with the concept while more information on the Genesis Frog was covered in the story such as frog breeding, the Prospitians’ and Consorts’ worship of the deity, and Derse’s detestation of it.\nI began to realize how important the Genesis Frog was to Homestuck’s big picture: the goal of Sburb is creation, and the main conflict in the story is preventing destruction. The most intensely cinematic End of Act as of this writing involved the assassination of two of these frogs as the result of a beautifully intricate plot and pushing the story towards its climax. One of my favorite aspects of Homestuck is its world-building (in some cases world-destroying), and I thought it would be fun to compose an album about an entity that quite literally contains its worlds.\nAlright already, I get it, but what about the music?\nFrom the very beginning I decided I wanted Genesis Frog to have its own unified sound, even back when it was “Homestuck Bestiary”. To accomplish this, I treated the album as a sort of orchestral suite, and it could certainly be referred to as such. Of course, getting a real orchestra to record this music is well beyond my means as an amateur composer, but I think the samples used in the album are high-fidelity and well-sequenced enough to be enjoyable.\nThere is a lot of continuity between tracks on the album, which lends itself well to the idea that it is an orchestral suite. Genesis Frog is really a singular work rather than a collection of somewhat related songs—I paid very special attention to the order of tracks and when certain recurring themes appear. The album has three main recurring musical motifs: the “Pondsquatter” theme (the main theme of the album and most frequently used), the “Divine” theme (which first shows up in Our Glorious Speaker), and the “Folklore” theme (which first shows up in Prospitian Folklore).\nThere are also a handful of musical devices and ostinati that find their way into various nooks and crannies that help contribute a sense of unity and are certainly fun to spot if you pay attention. I like to think all these snippets of musical material are treated the same way that repeated dialogue, situations and every other kind of callback are in Homestuck. If you recognize them you will enjoy the experience that much more, though the callbacks in the album are not that difficult to spot in my opinion, so it shouldn’t take as much effort as noticing Colonel Sassacre’s Daunting Text of Magical Frivolity and Practical Japery was heavy enough to kill a cat, and then finally doing so several thousand pages later.\nWhile the album does deviate somewhat from the orchestral sound in a few small instances, the instrumental ensemble remains relatively constant through each track, with the exception of percussion instruments that come and go and a short appearance by an electric guitar and bass, as well some much more eccentric instruments than those.\n<hr>\n<b>Some final thoughts, thank you’s, and croaks of acknowledgement</b>\nWow, did I really make it through the entire commentary without typing the word “ribbit”? Those of you who know me and my love for animal-based onomatopoeia are probably as shocked as I am. Perhaps more shocking is that I composed an entire album and only included two tracks with ribbits and croaks in them. And one of them is a bonus track, it’s a new personal record of some kind! Of course you shouldn’t expect me not to put animal noises in any album I ever compose, so don’t even go there. Alright, enough of that.\nI would like thank everyone who took the time to listen to Genesis Frog. The fact that I have an audience at all is something to be thankful for, and even if you didn’t enjoy it I appreciate you giving it a chance. Thank you to everyone anticipating the album for all their patience and support in the time before its release. Unfortunately I wasn’t ready to release it before the Homestuck Kickstarter happened, so it had to be delayed quite a bit. However, I believe the album is all the better for the extra time I had to work on it. Thanks to everyone on the MSPA Forums who voiced their excitement in the Homestuck music thread, or otherwise interacted with me or gave me advice of any kind. Thanks to all my Tumblr and Twitter followers for actually caring enough about what I have to say to follow me. I hope everyone who knows me or pays attention to what I do musically enjoyed this album, as well as people who were not familiar with me until now. I appreciate every single listener I have, and without you guys the only person listening to my music would be my mom and close friends, and somehow that doesn’t have the same sense of accomplishment to it.\nI have two very big thanks reserved for my two artists and collaborators, Marina and Rikuru. In a lot of ways this was a joint project, and their art is just as important to the album as the music. From the beginning I decided I wanted the album to be as unified visually as it is aurally, so I tried contacting two artists who were friends with each other and were capable of drawing in a unified style together. As it turned out I could not have made a better decision. Both Marina and Rikuru have knocked every piece of track art out the park the instant I saw them. Their artistic vision matched mine perfectly, and I truly feel that each piece of art they made was a faithful visual interpretation of my music in terms of color, tone, style and pretty much anything you could think of.\nThe three of us tossed around ideas a lot; I looked at sketches, I explained what each piece of music was about, the feelings the music conveyed were discussed. Amazingly the two of them were able to produce all the art necessary for the album and we didn’t end up needing any outside help. One of this album’s greatest strengths is definitely its unity, and working closely Marina and Rikuru ended up with a product I think we can all be proud of. Thanks so much for all your hard work, both of you. The album is that much better thanks to your artistic visions, and I hope you had just as much fun as I did working on it.\nYou can find the work of the artists here:\nMarina - <a href=\"https://sylladexter.tumblr.com/\">sylladexter.tumblr.com</a><br>Rikuru - <a href=\"https://quipster-rikuru.tumblr.com/\">quipster-rikuru.tumblr.com</a>\nI would also like to thank Toby “Radiation” Fox for being a constant friend and getting this album up and running. He’s always been a source of inspiration for me whether he knows it or not, and every time he’s given his input on my music it has helped me. Kudos to him taking care of so much business on behalf on the Homestuck music team and finding talented musicians in the community to help showcase their music in addition to the “official” (pfffahahaha) team’s.\nOf course I would like to make an obligatory thank you to Andrew Hussie for creating Homestuck, the entirety of which inspired this album (even the bits of it that don’t have frogs). Without his story I wouldn’t have had the opportunity to grow and interact with similar-minded musicians the way I have. And without his permission, I certainly wouldn’t have this album to show for myself. \nGenesis Frog has undergone quite the journey over the last couple of years, even if the larger portion of it took place inside my head as vague bubbles of inspiration. I was finally able to compose the music I had always wanted to compose and contribute my own voice and interpretation of Homestuck to its discography. This is an immense privilege and one I will always carry in my mind as one of the most important opportunities I ever had in my life. It’s an excellent time to be making music, and I will take everything I have learned in making this album with me as I continue to compose in the future. Thank you once again for listening, and make that a double thank you if you read through this extremely long-winded commentary.\nI am Alex Rosetti and I am a composer who loves video game music, whether it is listening to it, studying it, or making it.

The piece opens with a quartal chord in the harp, and after the atmosphere is established a solo clarinet introduces the main theme of the album.  A portion of the orchestra comes in after that and there’s a small swell before tapering off into a cello solo. The ensemble is pretty scarce in this one due to its subdued nature. There’s not a lot going on in this track overall, but it does its job both as the prelude to Pondsquatter and the album as a whole.",

It is a full realization of the album’s main theme, this time with the entire orchestra in tow and plenty of thematic development. I sort of have a love-hate relationship with this track. For one thing, it is the first piece I composed for the album and its melodic material served as its main groundwork, so it’s really important in that respect. But at the same time I had the least experience while initially composing it as compared the album’s other tracks, so I had to spend a lot of extra time fine-tuning it and developing it more (the original was barely under two minutes long). Still, considering the amount of work I had to put into it, it was one of the more rewarding tracks to work on.\nThe combination of Prelude and Pondsquatter to open the album with is something I thought about a lot, and in many ways they are one piece split into two parts. Consider this Movement II. Pondsquatter flows right out of Prelude and gradually adds to the orchestration. After a brief celesta interlude, the theme gets going in full. This piece has a sense of emerging, particularly out of the empty space of Prelude. There are plenty of woodwind trills and harp runs; I wanted them to feel like they were bursting out of the texture, and the openness of the quartal harmonies was eventually replaced by more triadic chords. Quartal chords retain some significance through the album, however, though they are certainly not prominent. I aimed to make the climax of this piece very satisfying, with the gong practically screaming “we’ve arrived!” but I was afraid of having too much of a sense of finality so I didn’t give the piece a proper ending. Instead it goes straight into the next track without only a hint at a cadence.",

        "commentary": "<i>Alex Rosetti:</i>\nMuch like Pondsquatter, the concept for this piece was conceived very early on in the album’s life before it became Genesis Frog. It was supposed to be a theme for the Prospitians, and it still mostly is, but now the piece focuses more on their devotion to the Speaker than the citizens themselves. The chess-people of Prospit are referenced a few times in Homestuck as worshipping the Genesis Frog, and it is through perusing their lore in various updates (mostly Seer: Descend) that I got inspiration for several tracks on the album, including this one.\nThe music was representing devotion, so I wanted it to have the warmest, most tranquil tone it could. There are two chorale-like sections, the first being the passage the strings play in the beginning, and then later in the brass when the rest of the orchestra drops out for a while. The style of this piece was inspired by Taku Iwasaki’s scores, which often feature very beautiful and lush string textures. I actually don’t think I captured that very well, and in fact strayed from that idea as the piece went on. But the core of the inspiration remains and I think one can tell if they are familiar with his style. Of note is the last third of the piece which is a self-indulgent, overly-romanticized arrangement of Erik Scheele’s Sarabande. It’s such a beautiful piece and I knew from the day I started working on this that I wanted to include it, no matter how schmaltzy I made it sound. Give me a break, it was fun, okay?",

At last in Skaia’s reflection through broken glass He may find the pond in which He’s meant to squat.” – Book in Prospit Library (from Seer: Descend)\nThis piece is a musical retelling of the above passage. If you read it while listening to the music, the tone should match for the most part (as long as you are reading very, very slowly). This track’s melody appears several more times throughout the album, and represents the “folk tale” and more legendary aspects of the Genesis Frog as seen through His followers. Because of this I tried to make it sound like a genuine folk tune, and ended up with something vaguely resembling a tune out of Eastern Europe. It’s a melancholic sort of melody, which suits the grim tone of the text it is based on. It is passed through several instruments: first a solo oboe, then the violins, a soprano recorder, and a trumpet.\nAfter the main section is over, the piece shifts into a short woodwind chorale, and then into what I can only call a cadenza made up of tense suspended figures in the strings with an out-of-meter pulse underneath. I kind of wrote this last section accidentally, since it somehow started flowing out of the chorale and I just went with it. It seemed to have an air of urgency and importance to me, so I kept it in to represent “Skaia’s reflection through broken glass”, which is such a fascinating image. Broken glass has been a recurring motif in Homestuck and seems to hold important consequences every time it occurs, and the text implies it will be significant in the Genesis Frog’s final destination. So the atmosphere of this final section felt significant and fitting to me.",

I decided it would both be fun and shake things up if I composed a theme for each group of Consorts we meet on the kids' four planets during their Sburb session. Represented are the Crocodiles of LOHAC, the Turtles of LOLAR, the Salamanders of LOWAS, and the Iguanas of LOFAF. Some are more characterized than others, but I made do and crafted a unique theme for each of them.\nThe character of the music during this section is a bit different than the rest of the album due to the inherent silliness of the creatures it is representing. The Consorts are all also, for lack of a better word, dumb. The music reflects that too. This intermezzo transitions from the serious tone of the first section of the album into the absurd rom that is about to follow. The idea of including two intermezzos in this album came from the Actraiser Symphonic Suite, a collection of orchestrations from the SNES game Actraiser that used this classic \"in between\" sort of music as a way to reiterate a recurring theme. I use these little movements in a slightly different manner, but the spirit is the same. Musically, this is a simple interlude that states all the Consort themes that are to come in a solo viola accompanied by pizzicato strings.",

        "commentary": "<i>Alex Rosetti:</i>\nWhere do I even start? This is one of my favorite tracks that I’ve made, and by that I mean to say I’m really amused I was able to come up with this in the first place. It originally wasn’t part of this album at all—it was supposed to be a short jingle for the LOHAC Stock Exchange! But it was too much fun to let go of and soon it morphed into a full-fledged character theme for everyone’s beloved, excitable consorts. The general idea behind the music was this: Jit may have made a silly arrangement of Atomyk Ebonpyre, but what could I do to put it in an even more ridiculous context? And so it was that it became the manic violin and xylophone old-timey television music-inspired (this was my only frame of reference for what I thought stock exchange music should sound like) tune that it is now. And wouldn’t you know it, this type of music turned out to fit the personality of the Crocodiles like a crocodile-fitted glove.\nIn terms of pacing, I thought it was crucial to place this as the first Consort track. The first four tracks of the album all range from relatively slow to moderately less slow, so I really needed something to break out. This is the most energetic and fast-paced of the four Consort themes, so for my money it was the best choice to introduce this section of the album and keep interest instead of having too many low-energy tracks in a row. However, this isn’t to say I was able to resist the temptation to put a slow middle section into this piece, which provides a little break from all the pandemonium. But more importantly, it set the stage for an incredibly silly idea I had to record a bunch of people nakking like maniacs to sound like the Crocodiles, and then have that gradually crescendo into the last section of the piece.\nIn what is of some note, I tried to feature each of the Kids’ instruments in their respective Consort theme. Dave’s usual turntable affair was impossible for me to consider for this style of music, though I’m sure some incredibly talented person could have pulled it off. Instead, the piece uses xylophone heavily, since I was operating under the logic that both turntables and xylophones sort of fall under the percussion category? I will admit it’s a bit of a stretch.\nI would like to thank the following contributors for lending their beautiful, sonorous voices to this piece of music:\n- nyanface\n- Hayden Lombard\n- Tawawa\n- Rachel Rose Mitchell\n- Thom Rosell\n- Marcy Nabors\n- Kyle Chung\n- Ben Sharrin\n- Max Wright\n- Katie Caldwell",

        "commentary": "<i>Alex Rosetti:</i>\nThis was a difficult one to compose. The Turtles in Homestuck haven’t been given much characterization other than the ones quaking in fear of Rose, and even then that characteristic is basically the extent of it. I wondered if it was even worth writing a theme for them, since their importance to the story is minimal; what kind of music would I compose for them, anyway? But in the end I decided if I was going to do a set of Consort pieces I was going to do it right and that meant composing the whole package. There was going to be a cycle of fun, lighthearted pieces on this album regardless of characterization or story relevance.\nUnfortunately, by the time I decided this I had absolutely no musical ideas. I knew I wanted to give the piece a sort of awkward, wooden sound, so I had a pretty good idea of what timbres I needed (wood blocks, marimba, bassoons, etc.). Then I decided to just outright make it as quirky as possible and added a contrabassoon, even giving it the melody at one point, because hey, I might as well have fun with a track where I’m making up 90% of a character interpretation. Violin was included to fit the theme of the Consorts’ music matching their kids’ instruments. I eventually settled on a tired-sounding little melody, and while it is appropriate it’s the not my favorite one I’ve ever written. You can probably tell too, since it never seems to go anywhere, and when it finally sounds like it is it drops out and a different variation starts playing.\nThe middle section is a very loosely based on the Pondsquatter theme, and the high register marimba interjection makes it obvious in case you didn’t pick up on it in the first five notes. This eventually leads back into the main melody of the piece, and a couple sequences later it ends. I wonder how much it shows that I was really short on ideas for this piece. Any time it was playing up the comedy in timing or shifting feel, it felt more like I had no idea what to do and desperately stuck something in so the piece could move on. Maybe I’m being hard on it; I still think it is enjoyable to listen to. But from a compositional standpoint, it is probably the weakest on the album.",

        "commentary": "<i>Alex Rosetti:</i>\nThis piece picks up where Buy NAK Sell DOOF left off, meaning it goes right back into a silly, dimwitted march. This time however, we are joined by John’s signature instrument, the electric organ! I also put some piano in there I guess, but baby, it is all about that organ. Maybe it gives it a bit too much of a “baseball flavor” but that’s okay, the Salamanders are sporting folks. Right off the “bat”, you will notice the opening ostinato bears a strong resemblance to Danny Elfman tomfoolery, which is entirely coincidental; not that I have any problems with Danny Elfman tomfoolery, in fact I enjoy it very much.\nLike the Crocodiles, the Salamanders have gotten plenty of characterization in Homestuck, so it was pretty easy to write their theme. They actually have a lot in common with the Crocodiles (mostly that they are enthusiastically unintelligent), which is why I decided to give them the same kind of style. There is a primary theme and a secondary theme, and they are both developed throughout the course of the piece. I realize this is an incredibly simple and non-specific description, but it is a very straightforward piece in that regard, and I don’t know what else to say about it. The first theme is a bouncy little tune, and the second theme is more legato and chromatic, and they fit together in various ways when they interact with each other.\nI sort of envisioned this composition as a dual piano/organ concerto in terms of how I treated the instruments. Both are featured over the orchestra, and play off it with plenty of silly textures and orchestrations. Stylistically, the oom-pah marching characteristics combined with the instrumentation may call to mind images of a circus, which is in fact how the piece got its name. It’s kind of a veiled reference, but if you know what the title is referring to then it’s easy to figure out why it resembles circus music. And of course in the spirit of things, for one last antic I finished it off with a slide whistle; an instrument I thought represented the salamanders’ bubbles pretty well.",

Ever since the Iguanas were introduced I was terrified someone was going to use this pun before I had a chance to put it out in an official capacity. I wanted to be the thip king, and despite being nervous about it for almost two years no one usurped my throne. Even as of this writing, searching for that exact phrase on the internet will yield no results. Obviously if you are reading this, that is no longer true. But I digress.\nAs for the piece itself, I decided to separate it into two very distinct sections. The first depicts the Iguanas’ life in the Land of Frost and Frogs before Jade stokes the Forge (which, incidentally, is the name of a later track which takes this concept even further); the second part depicts their life after the frost has melted away. Due to this structure, the first third of the piece is subdued and establishes a calm atmosphere with the strings and woodwinds, with not a single brass instrument to be found. The opening motive that continues to be used throughout the piece is an almost exact repetition of the Salamanders’ main motive. All the Consort tracks are connected, but these two take it to the next level by building this piece’s base off the main material of the last.\nThe second part is where things get interesting. It is the only section of the album where I drop the orchestra shtick completely and use an ensemble of recorders, crumhorns, pipes, and an unconventional rhythm section featuring a dulcimer. I thought about what kind of music the Iguanas would make if given the opportunity. I figured they would have a lot of primitive instruments at hand and would produce simple, joyous music. This whole section is unabashedly a tribute to Kumi Tanioka’s work in Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles. It’s a sort of re-imagining of this world of ancient instruments that she created, and it was one of my earliest influences. There are also seeds of Yasunori Mitsuda in here; it is such a fun piece that I don’t mind citing very strong influences here if people want to hear similar music to this.",

The sequence of tracks was very carefully chosen for this album, and it is especially true here. Every track from here on out details the journey undertaken to create the Genesis Frog, as well as its ultimate fate. From the ectobiological breeding (Breeding Duties), to the unfreezing of the Land of Frost and Frogs (Stoke the Forge), to the hunt for frogs (Great LOFAF Expedition of 2009), to the mysteries and certain doom hiding in the frog temple (The Temple’s Withered Bloom), and finally to the destruction of the universe (Bilious), a story is told through music. As a conclusion, we bear witness to the fate the Genesis Frog is meant to fulfill: finding His pond in Skaia (Speaker), and signifying the creation of a new universe (The Vast Croak).\nThis intermezzo changes the tone from the lighthearted Consort music to something more full of wonder to suit the story to come. It is a simple swell based on the Pondsquatter theme, and once it settles down, the texture becomes very sparse so as to lead into Breeding Duties.",

It’s a great line, and Jade’s dumbfounded reaction is even better. Naturally I wanted this to be an awkward-sounding piece, so in the beginning there is plenty of pizzicato strings, strange pauses and the like. Of course, more thought went into the mood than that; Jade has a small association with witches, even if it is only in title and costume. The idea that she is the Witch of Space and is dabbling in ectobiology with frogs put a lot of images in my mind, the most obvious connection being a witch’s cauldron. How would this type of music sound, exactly? Eventually I settled on the sort of faux-baroque feel mixed in with plenty of silliness, since this is a piece about Jade and frogs, after all. The orchestration is full of fast-decaying timbres like the aforementioned pizzicato and liberal use of harpsichord. I also included celesta since it adds a sort of whimsy to the piece, and it has the added bonus of calling back to the beginning of the album.\nThe main motive is a very baroque sort of device, and I used it that way a little, though I mostly put it in ridiculous contexts. The opening is very stately and lively; what a way to open the last third of the album! But after the first phrase it immediately drops out into a very spacious world, and it is during this section that I explore a variety of colors while playing with the motivic material. Then I prove how short my attention span is because the music goes a lot of places fast after that. First it takes a sweet tone with a celesta melody, and then feels majestic with a lyrical cello line and a call in the horns. If you were to think about this piece programmatically, then that might be the moment when Jade finally successfully breeds the frog with the right genes. In which case the rest of the piece is about hundreds of frogs hopping around or something, which is an explanation I like, but will not officially state since I wasn’t actually thinking much about a story when composing this.\nBut still, I did have a lot of scenes brewing in my head with this one, so I think it is totally appropriate to imagine a story going along with it. Anyway, the majestic section cuts off for a few seconds, then a booming section based on the opening stumbles in and leaves as fast as it entered. From that point on the material from Pondsquatter comes in and is given the same feel as the rest of this piece, and if there was any one word I had to describe this last section with it would be, “shenanigans”. Incidentally, I consider this and Great LOFAF Expedition of 2009 to be the heart of the album. There will be more on that later in the commentary.",

        "commentary": "<i>Alex Rosetti:</i>\nWhy did I compose this piece? Well, mainly because I wanted something bombastic to use an anvil as percussion in. But I also wrote it because of its importance in the role of each Space player’s planet and their frog breeding duties. Not only that, but it acts as a transition from the darker Breeding Duties to the lighter, more energetic Great LOFAF Expedition of 2009. More specifically, it extends the idea behind Thip of the Tongue to three tracks instead of one; it is a progression from the planet’s frosty beginnings to a sudden and beautiful spring, and this piece heralds that moment. In any case, I ended up with a pretty fun piece that may not be the most impressive on the album, but it definitely serves a purpose and keeps the flow intact.\nThe piece opens with a brass fanfare based off the Folklore theme interspersed with anvil and bass drum hits. The decision to feature the anvil came from Dave’s denizen, Hephaestus, who is referred to as “Lord of the Forge” with little explanation other than he desired access to Jade’s Forge to repair the Caledfwlch. In fact, the entire piece has the feeling of hammering, since harsh gestures in the brass and strings are common in combination with liberal usage of timpani and bass drum. The entire piece is in Dorian, which is a mode I can rarely resist composing in, and it lends a big sense of adventure to it. Formally there is not a lot going on, other than a melody being repeated several times with different orchestration and transposition. An interesting moment occurs when the entire ensemble drops out and a flute solo comes in playing a lighter, more humorous version of the tune before heading towards the climax. All in all, it is a pretty standard theme with a solid tune despite the fact that nothing extraordinary happens for its duration. But hey, we wouldn’t want overkill would we? I was saving that for the next track.",

        "commentary": "<i>Alex Rosetti:</i>\n Ah, frog-hunting music. I had the idea for this track brewing long before Homestuck Volume 8 was in the works, so you can imagine my horror when not one, but two tracks with this subject were on it. I have to give props to Jit and Bowman, those are a couple of great pieces and they both explore the idea in unique ways. I lamented however, worrying my track would be extraneous. How many times could we repeat the same, specific idea, after all? So I had to think outside the box a little bit. I would try to capture the entire experience of not just the hunt, but exploring LOFAF after the Forge had been stoked. This piece is programmatic in the same sense Breeding Duties is—it is meant to be a collection of musical ideas depicting any number of scenes the listener might imagine. Which isn’t to say the music isn’t thematically grounded; it is essentially based on one theme in addition to the Pondsquatter theme, which also has a large presence.\n Earlier in the commentary for Breeding Duties, I referred to that and this track as being the heart of this album. It may sound hokey, but when I think of Genesis Frog I think of these two tracks. I think they exemplify the kind of music I’ve had in my head for two years and wanted to compose most. When I first thought of them, I knew Genesis Frog as an album would work, this was the kind of music I had always wanted to listen to but no one had quite made yet. This isn’t to say it’s anything new or innovative; merely that it is a specific sound I love that I wanted to hear. I think the album experience is purest during these two tracks, as ridiculous or pretentious as that may sound, but I don’t know how else to say it. Great LOFAF Expedition of 2009 is made up of so many of my favorite things to do in orchestral music, so for better or worse you can use this as a roadmap for my compositional output and ridicule me as I become more and more of a slave to my own style.\n It opens with a solo horn call to signify the beginning of the hunt. Normally these sorts of calls are based around perfect fifths, but I totally broke the rules like the rebel I am and used it as a way to introduce the main theme. After that, the piece is split into three sections, the first being a march featuring a piccolo playing a variation on the Pondsquatter theme. The orchestration gradually fills in, and an ostinato is introduced in the xylophone and santoor (a string instrument native to India) that is used throughout the piece. After the march, we dive into the undergrowth, represented by the next section.\n The music makes a shift into 7/8, though no true pulse is really established. As a result, many different lines of counterpoint come in at disjointed intervals, lending to the image of a lot of different frogs hopping around in the depths of the forest. The pace picks up again when the music shifts back to simple meter and the march rhythm is brought back. There is more counterpoint here with the main motive of the piece; it is overlayed with itself in several different rhythmic rhythmic transpositions over the march ostinato. Then, after a brief interlude, the piece shifts back into 7/8 with more of a pulse, and the Pondsquatter theme is repeated in full followed by a coda based on this piece’s motive. This is one of the few pieces on the album that ends on an unambiguous tonic chord, which I thought was very refreshing at this point. Especially in light of this piece, which I promised would be overkill thanks to all the ridiculous directions it manages to go in for its duration of five minutes.",

        "commentary": "<i>Alex Rosetti:</i>\nThis is an interesting one, since it has probably undergone the most change in terms of concept and musical ideas before I finally composed it in earnest. It started out as a general Frog Temple theme, and all along I had the idea to explore sweeping chords in the strings and choir, which I did end up doing, albeit in a very different fashion than I expected. I tossed around the idea of including material from Jit’s Ruins, then I thought about adapting an old wind ensemble piece of mine. Conceptually I switched from the idea of the Frog Temple to the hieroglyphics inside, tentatively naming it “Temple Walls”, then “Glyphs”.\nWhat ended up happening was that I ended up composing this and the next track as one whole, and then split them into two, so in a lot of ways the two of them combined could be considered a single piece. In fact, I would venture to say the last four tracks on the album could be considered four connected movements among the greater whole, since I added more continuity between them than any previous tracks on the album. Because of the connection to the last track, which is heavily about Jack Noir, I decided to have this music represent the Lotus Time Capsule he went through during Cascade. The lotus being in the frog temple was very convenient for me since I got to keep that idea without straying too much from the theme of the album. So this track ended up being the calm before the storm as it were, representing the menace hiding inside the temple for centuries before coming out to wreak havoc.\nThe piece opens with a major chord in the strings, as if to continue the train of thought left behind by the previous track’s end. However, the chord quickly changes into something more dissonant, and the tone shifts from light to dark. The choir answers the strings, and the piece progresses in this manner with the two sections being featured the most. A gamelan ensemble plays in the background, very out of tune with the rest of the ensemble, lending to the sense of foreboding. There is a musical device in here that represents Jack, a descending line that implies a tritone. It comes in quietly and at irregular intervals, indicative of the murderous asshole lying in wait among the confines of the temple. As the music progresses, this motive comes in more and more until it is an ostinato under the chordal strings and choir. Eventually the piece crescendos and leads into the next track, where Jack is finally the star of the show.",

        "commentary": "<i>Alex Rosetti:</i>\nPoor Bilious Slick. Every iteration of Him we’ve seen in Homestuck has been brutally murdered in one way or another. As if that wasn’t enough, He is primarily known by the spiteful nickname Dersites have given Him. In composing this album, I would have missed a big opportunity if I didn’t take material from those in Derse that oppose creation, most specifically Jack Noir. The title of course came from the name Bilious Slick, but it also has the benefit of adding grotesque imagery to a piece of music about Jack slaughtering a giant universe frog. It is a continuation of The Temple’s Withered Bloom, and it picks up where it left off with Jack exiting the Lotus Capsule, escaping the session and eventually going on to destroy the universe he emerged from.\nThe piece opens right away in 10/8, and an electric guitar, bass, and drum set are added to the ensemble. I decided that among the pastoral and bouncy, lighthearted pieces in this album, there was no single track that felt like a hook to me. I wanted to attempt to compose something that just plain kicks ass, some climactic piece that could act as a reward for listening through the relatively calm album. Naturally I came to the decision to include guitar and drums and let more rock influence come through.\nThe theme is based on the Folklore theme, which I thought was appropriate and somewhat ironic, since what represented creation before was now being used to represent destruction. The guitar takes over the melody as the meter goes through several changes, and after several consecutive contrasting sections that play with different motives, the guitar once again begins the next section by establishing a triplet ostinato.\nAt this point I figured, what the hell, I’ll quote Black. It actually fits quite well with the “Jack” device from The Temple’s Withered Bloom that I bring back here, thanks to the fact that they both emphasise on the tritone. My own Jack motive begins to take over from Radiation’s, and eventually the strings are playing it in canon as it gets more and more chaotic, until everything drops out and the lower piano register begins an ostinato based on it. The orchestra builds again into more chaotic textures, the tension drops briefly, and then the theme is recapped as the climax. All in all it is probably the most exciting piece on the album, and for my first foray into more action-like music, I think it does its job well.",

        "commentary": "<i>Alex Rosetti:</i>\nOut of destruction comes nothingness, and the only sounds are sparse and atmospheric. The nothingness persists for a bit, a result of the universe’s destruction in the previous track. If I were feeling really dark I could just end the album there, but I wanted there to be a sense of conclusion and returning to what once was. What better way than to have the music rise from the ashes and the solo clarinet come back to play a new version of the Pondsquatter theme? The idea behind the countless Genesis Frogs is that they propagate one another, each frog producing the next, and behind this lies the idea of infinity and repeated processes. So I wanted the album to do a Mobius Double Reacharound as it were, and end as it began. So the pairing of Speaker and The Vast Croak echoes the earlier pairing of Prelude and Pondsquatter.\nThis piece even has the same structure and general idea as Prelude before going into a full statement of the modified theme. As a result it is difficult to talk about its composition, since it is virtually the same as Prelude only with varying material. The clarinet emerges out of the atmosphere just as before, and a texture-based section builds this time not into a false climax, but into a fuller orchestration of what the clarinet was doing earlier. It ends simply and quietly in the woodwinds, allowing the next and final track to proceed with its exciting start.",

        "commentary": "<i>Alex Rosetti:</i>\nAfter six notes from the drumset, the grand finale begins. I still don’t have a clear idea what prompted this sort of conclusion to the album. For the longest time I intended to end it the way Speaker did, and that track indeed had a finality of its own. But I wanted something exciting at the end, and I felt like there was still momentum left over from Bilious that I could do something with. So despite only having a vague idea of what the Vast Croak probably was at the time of this composing it, I ran with my assumptions and based the album’s last hurrah around that idea. What little information existed implied the Genesis Frog will Croak once He has matured, and I can only assume it signifies the birth of the new universe in some way. I hope my interpretation does not end up conflicting with canon, and even if it does with any luck the music will still match the tone of it and my thoughts will remain hidden in this commentary.\nKanaya described the Vast Croak as the most amazing thing she had ever seen. I doubt anything I compose could possibly match the scope of such a cosmic event, but I at least attempted to capture the excitement of such a thing happening. When one thinks of the Vast Croak being put to music I’m sure bombastic orchestrations come to mind, like bass drum hits and gongs swelling, the brass going wild. Maybe that would have been the right direction to go in. Of all the tracks on this album this one probably puzzles me the most, since I’m not sure exactly why I decided to go in the direction I did musically. I wouldn’t be surprised if a lot of people think it isn’t appropriate for its namesake, and maybe someone else could compose something more suitable at some point. All I can say is that I wanted to capture the excitement of the moment and create something that felt like joy spilling forth. I wanted the music to have a big sense of happiness and accomplishment, a feeling of “yeah, we did it!” Even if it did not capture the feeling of the Vast Croak in as literal a sense as it could have, the music has the kind of feeling I imagine players would have upon reaching this final, monumental goal. That is my defense, and I am sticking by it.\nThe sense of excitement is what prompted me to bring the drumset back. I thought the piece needed a percussive drive like Bilious had, so I employed the same method. And hell, if I’m going to bring drumset into an orchestral setting then I might as well do it a second time. The Dorian version of the Pondsquatter theme played by the horns and trombones is reminiscent of its use in Prospitian Folklore. In fact, the second phrase appears exactly as it did in that piece and after repeating it goes straight into the Folklore theme. At this point in the music I thought it was appropriate to quote some of the themes from earlier in the album as a sort of “B” section. I mixed together all the Consort themes once the Folklore theme ended and snuck in a little bit of Breeding Duties. I liked the idea of bringing all these themes back, since presumably all of them would have a role once again in the new universe being created.\nThe A section then returns in a transposed form before the piece ends in a very big fashion. When all appears to be said and done and the very last of the reverberation is dying off, the harp comes in. It is followed by clarinet, piano, celesta, and finally the violins playing harmonics; this is the instrumentation the album opened with. This small ensemble plays a subdued arrangement of Pondsquatter, and the album ends as it began in the vastness of paradox space. If you start the album over again, you will find that it flows seamlessly from the ending to beginning. Somewhere in this revelation lies my ultimate artistic intent with Genesis Frog, which probably involves something about infinity’s endless repetition, or life always finding a way forward, or something along those lines depending on how pretentious you want to think of me as.",

I hope people are still enjoying it and continuing to discover little nuances I hid in the music. Thanks so much everyone.\n<hr>\nDuring my Junior year of college, I had the opportunity to have one of my pieces read by the acclaimed Talea Ensemble, a chamber group that was visiting my college and doing a performance there. They graciously offered to read through student works and provide commentary for us. I took advantage of this in an odd way and arranged Pondsquatter for Pierrot Ensemble, an instrumentation that consists of piano, violin, cello, flute, clarinet, and in some cases percussion. This recording was made during a runthrough they did of it, and what you should keep in mind is that this was all sightread. Obviously the performance is not perfect, and I’m slightly afraid of sharing this in case I embarrass the ensemble with it, but I can guarantee that had they prepared it beforehand, it would have been perfect. However, even without prior preparation, the performance is astounding and I thank them dearly.\nIn case you are reading this online and are unable to buy the album to obtain this bonus track, you can find it on both my website and my music blog, the URLs of which are provided at the end of this commentary.",

        "commentary": "<i>Elly Beck:</i>\n(<a href=\"https://yoccu.tumblr.com/post/12976423564/\">Tumblr</a>)\nSo I had heard about kali needing more people to do album art from somebody on tumblr.  I was relatively new to the fandom, and I thought I’d never in a million years be good enough to do album art, but I really wanted to, so I sucked it up, said to myself, “The worst thing they can do is tell me No and then forget about me forever,” so I sent my offer.  And got it?????????\nThen I had to pick an ancestor, and even though I didn’t even care about kanaya at the time, when I thought it through, I decided that I’d probably be best at drawing her ancestor.  I figured her classy, demure style would work best with my style of drawing?  So I picked kancestor!\nThen I didn’t draw for forever because not knowing what the ancestor looked like made me really nervous.  Then she was revealed finally!!!  And I freaked out and got to drawing.\nI decided I wanted to draw something that would represent a big part of her character.  Since I hadn’t heard the song, all I really knew was that if I drew something that was very much a part of her character, it would most likely fit.\nSo I decided to pick a “scene” of her very first leaving the caverns to take care of the signless.  Since she has jade blood, I figured she would probably sneak out around daybreak, when no other trolls would be around to see her abandoning her duties.  She had to wrap up tiny grub sufferer so that he wouldn’t be hurt by the sunlight, but she would be able to leave without injury.\nShe has her flowy....cloth thing...that’s normally around her feet up over her head as a veil.  It’s really bright if you’ve never been outside of a cave your whole life, after all!  So she’s lifting it here to take her first look at light on the surface.\nI’m really happy it ended up working so well with the song, and this may be my favorite song from the album because I am a huge sucker for woeful strings.  The song reminds me a LOT of Adagio for Strings which may just be one of the most heartwrenchingly beautiful songs ever written.\nSo hopefully my art of her here is a good representation of her character.  I’ve been worried about how it would have been received ever since I finished it! hahaha.  But people seem to be liking it, and I couldn’t be happier.  I was so honored and ecstatic to be given to opportunity to draw for an album, and it was so much fun.\nThat’s all I really had to say I guess. :)  I just felt like sharing my thought process.  xD  Thanks to kali again for the opportunity and the BEAUTIFUL album.  The ancestors have been well represented here I think. c:\n(<a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/yoccuri/art/Immaculate-Peacekeeper-269739813\">DeviantArt</a>)\nforgot to upload this here too! :o for all y'all who use dA still and not just tumblr like me xD\nI did the album art for the Dolorosa's song from the new Tomb of the Ancestors album! :)\nI wrote some commentary about why I drew it and why I drew this specifically on tumblr. You can go read it there if you are interested in a little background on this piece\nThis was a huge challenge artistically! My mom and I puzzled over some fabric trying to figure out how the heck drapery like that veil/cloth thing would even work! The colors and background were a specifically challenging element as well! I really wanted it to be good track art, where you would be able to recognize it at a glance on an mp3 player or computer or something else. And I wanted the picture as a whole to feel like the Dolorosa's character, which I imagine as being solemn and peaceful\nThe song ended up beautiful! I didn't actually get to hear ANY of it until the album was released, so I'm really glad that kali and I were on roughly the same wavelength about her :)\nI hope you all like it! I was an honor and a privilege to get to do this. I'm so grateful ;w;",

    "commentary": "<i>Robert J! Lake:</i> (project manager)\nThis almost didn't happen.\nAs of release day, it's been exactly four full years since the last numbered Homestuck volume, with only one full album between then and now.\nIn fact, it's now actually been a longer time since the last numbered homestuck volume than the time between Homestuck beginning and it coming out. That's crazy, right?\nCan you believe there was a time whne Homestuck albums were coming out every month?\nVolume 10's been an open question since the moment Volume 9 got released. Every few months, the music team would talk about it, maybe float a song or two for it, then nothing. Which, you know. Process. Life happens. A lot of us went to college, maybe lost interest, moved on to making smash hit games, what have you. We splintered. Fans wondered if it'd ever happen. I've gotten messages about it basically ad infinitum over the past four years, and it's not helped by one-off mentions here and there teasing it endlessly.\nPeople want to know what's up!\nWell, finally, here it is. If Volume 9 is the culmination of over three years of musical evolution and growth for its musicians, Volume 10 is the reunion tour. For those of us returning, it's our chance to show how much better we got while we were gone (I think you'll agree we've improved quite a bit).\nAs for the new faces, I think their work speaks for itself.\nThis isn't only the tightest, most consistent, most listenable numbered volume we've done, it's the one we've put the most love into.\nI hope you enjoy what I've spent the past few months wrangling together with some of the most talented people I know.\nI present the final Homestuck Volume.\n...Probably.\n<i>Marcy Nabors:</i> (co-organizer, mastering engineer)\nHomestuck Volume 10, the big 1-0!\nI can only begin to describe what a personally significant moment it is to be releasing this album. Homestuck has been huge for me; the enthusiastic community and the countless friends it's helped me to meet, the sprawling fantastical expanse that is the comic itself, and perhaps most notably, the outrageous wealth of great music.\nAlmost six years ago, the Homestuck discography served as the push I needed to realize that I could chase my dreams in the world of independent music, and today I'm proud to call many of these immeasurably talented musicians some of my closest friends.\nPutting this album together has been an absolute pleasure, and I think it's a fitting conclusion to this seven-year-long tradition of incredible creativity.\nEnjoy the tunes!\n<i>Lexxy:</i> (cover artist)\nHomestuck will always hold a warm, nostalgic place in my heart, so despite drafting up a handful of concepts - from the graphic and representational to the tongue-in-cheek referential - I ultimately ended up going with the one that expressed that affection the most.",

        "commentary": "<i>Seth Peelle:</i>\nWhen I first auditioned for the Homestuck music team back in 2009, one of my two audition pieces was [[Pumpkin Cravings]], which ended upon the \"Homestuck Vol. 5\" album of the following year (and was subsequently orchestrated by the illustrious Alex Rosetti into [[THIS Pumpkin]] on THIS Album). The other piece was a short electronic-sounding demo entitled \"Skaia Voyages\" that I based on the [[Sburban Jungle]] and [[Skies of Skaia]] themes, inspired by the purposefully vague notion of the Kids' \"ascension\" recently introduced in the comic at that time. The demo never ended up going anywhere in that form, but its musical ideas stuck in my head, growing and evolving in my mindscape over the years into something much grander than what I had originally envisioned. It grew additional references to [[Revelawesome]] and the Kids' themes, grew a full orchestra, grew a massive choir and epic sci-fi noises of indeterminate nature...\nAnd then - eventually - it became REAL.\nIt ASCENDED.\n(yes it was totally that easy.<br>no you can't stop me from pretending this.)\n<i>PJ Tush:</i>\nWOW 7 years of Homestuck. I only hopped on this hectic bandwagon in 2011, but it was definitely worth it. I NEVER would have expected to be able to contribute to and take part in Homestuck itself. This is like a dream come true. THAT BEING SAID: CREATA!\nCreata was heard in short ([[Creata (Canon Edit)]]) during the first part of Collide, so being able to listen to the full version of the song and then DRAW for it was pretty cathartic (i might have cried). When drawing for Creata, I wanted to capture the \"essence of creation\" and highlight the greater purpose of the Beta kids in the creation of their universe. The piece is long and explosive, much like one would expect the creation of an entire universe to be. I wanted to depict a climactic moment, something grandiose and defining that fits in with the end of Homestuck properly. What better event than the Genesis Frog finally blooming with the original quartet?\n(i definitely did cry)",

I'd been watching a lot of Ruroni Kenshin with the girlfriend on Netflix and because this art was done by me as a last minute switcheroo I didn't have much time, so I did what I do best; I was a piece of weeaboo trash and made this ridiculous fake shounen manga panel in manga studio.\nThe Japanese reads \"Usagi o hako ni modore\": \"Put the bunny back in the box\".\nThe next day I landed a job working at a Sake company.

For all the highs and lows in the Homestuck fandom the way the fandom appreciated fanmusic was special.\n<i>David Dycus</i>: (composer, synths)\nHomestuck gave me a sense of musical purpose I have not experienced before or since.\n...Actually, that sounds stupid.

Goal here was mainly to create a \"Terezi doing something badass\" track: A little inspiration from things like \"Battle without Honor or Humanity\" from Kill Bill, sprinkled with little bits inspired by Terezi's theme, then a bit of weir dguitar solo for Harlequin to represent Gamzee, and a whole load of staccato strings and rhythm guitar everywhere else.\nOriginally called \"JUDG3M3NT D4Y\" but we already have a track called [[Judgment Day]].\nWe've literally used all the names.\n\"Sound Judgement\" works better though, although it should probably be \"Smell Judgement\"?\nThat sounds ridiculous though.\n<i>Sera B.:</i>\nFor this piece I wanted to go really comic book-y, so I leaned towards a Daredevil influence for Terezi (for obvious reasons). Initially, I had her in a more dtailed setting in extreme light and shadow, with Gamzee's silhouette looming over her. Totally by accident I ended up deleting the background layers, leaving just the strip of red lava as the orizon-- which looked way cooler than what I had before and gave it the comic-book-cover vibe I was shooting for. Super fun piece to work on!",

And it turned out pretty awesome.\nThe guitar performances haven't changed since the first recording, but just about everything to do with the mix and virtual instruments have been tweaked.\nAt the time, I was very influenced by Gojira, most noticeably in the rhythm guitars' super rythmic chugging around.\nAnd a fun fact: the double kick drum is augmented by a sample of the kick drums used in Septic Flesh's song \"Anubis\" to give it that perfect death metal punch.\n<i>Seth Massey:</i>\nSome of the more \"mechanical\" designs in Sburb were fricken cool.\nWish we saw more of them.",

Lake:</i>\nCascade2 has a strange following online.\nThe post with the track itself (feel free to google around to find it) isn't that popular (though, relative to the rest of my blog, it's practically Michael Jackson) but the people who've heard it and like it are very vocal about it getting a release.\nSo, you know, here it is. Freefall hems pretty close to my original remix's overall arrangement, except it swaps out all the samples for newly recorded material (all me) and riffs way, way more loosely on the song quotes. This song is older than [S] Cascade is, and I think the difference between the original version from all those years ago and this is one of the most striking comparisons you can make to show how far I've come.\n<i>Nico J. Dolloso:</i>\nI was approached by RJ to do a track art of my choosing for the album and decided to work closely with him for the track \"Freefall.\" The track's subject was the EoA5 flash '[S] Cascade', which was from what I remember a clusterfuck on so many levels in the Homestuck universe and for the MSPA wegbsite &amp; Newground's hosting servers.\nIt sure was a ride I'll never forget.\nI'm pretty content with the result despite having a short notice to finish it. I wanted to reflect on the clusterfuck of the flash's narrative in these glass shards falling from the area of impact; I love compositions where you can notice something new every time you look closely at it. It also fit well with the title of the track as well.\nI also remember there being a lot of contrasting colours in the original flash, so I played with those in this image as well.\nVery glad to be able to have the opportunity to draw something for the album overall!",

Given the title of the track, a castle-exploration scene seemed to be a given.\nI knew I wanted to draw the trolls, and liked the idea of depicting Terezi and Vriska during the post-retcon timeline. So I went with one of the castles we see in a Dream Bubble.\nAlthough, compared to the vibe the song gives off, The Scourge Sisters seem a little too excited to be exploring this creepy old place. The piece needed something to give it a more ominous tone. A scrapped concept involved Karkat and the Mayor, so I put them in the forefront here to add a sense of urgency and foreboding - they're probably not in any actual danger, but Karkat's not gonna let his beloved Mayor get wrapped up in Terezi and Vriska's castle-plundering shenanigans. Visually, I was mianly inspired by the illustrations seen during the ending credits of Cave Story, and how effectively they used limited, almost monochromatic color palettes. I cycled through a lot of different colors for the piece before deciding on the blue/purple gradient here.\nStill not sure which one I like best!\nIn hindsight, I could have easily set this piece in any of the castles on Prospit or Derse, but then I couldn't easily include the Mayor. And I really, REALLY wanted to draw the Mayor.\nBesides, pursuing a more obscure concept forced me to get more creative with the scenario and composition.\nSo, ultimately, it's a win-win!",

        "commentary": "<i>Seth Peelle:</i>\nThe 1984 fantasy film \"The NeverEnding Story\" was one of my favorite childhood movies.\nIt was the first movie I ever remember watching at the theater, in fact!\nAnd the film's fantastic soundtrack by Giorgio Moroder and Klaus Doldinger had a lasting impact on my own musical creativity. Doldinger's high-energy orchestral theme \"Bastian's Happy Flight\", in particular, is something special that has stuck with me throughout my life like few musical pieces have - an inspiring masterpiece embodying childlike wonderment in its purest form.\nAndrew Hussie liked that movie, too, I guess.\nSo when Hussie came by my house riding a long magic dog through the sky and causing the absurd movie-referencing shenanigans called Homestuck, I somehow knew that the only proper response was to mash together the \"Skaian Ride\" and \"Skies of Skaia\" themes into a nostalgic homage to Mr. Doldinger's soundtrack.\n(I am sure Mr. DOldinger - much like a certain ill-fated group of bullies - never could have seen THAT one coming.)\n<i>Alyssa Lee Dalangin:</i>\nI wanted to illustrate Skaian Happy Flight when I heard it because the music was so whimsical and uplifting, I knew doing the imagery to match it would be fun. When I asked the musician what their vision was for a scenario or character, they said they didn't have anything in particular in mind (though they mentioned some influences from The Neverending story, which Homestuck also referenced. There's a tiny Hussie riding a dragon in the background of my picture, based off a comic page I was shown, haha!)\nJust based off the song title, I decided to draw John flying through some pretty Skaian scenery, so I set to work doing preliminary brainstorming. I mostly wanted to settle on cohesive shape language for the sky and the trees, since I already had an idea of the overall composition, and I really wanted the picture to be wispy. Unfortunately I didn't save too many WIP shots, but my sketch was pretty straightforward and most of the struggle came from deciding the colors for John...\nOne of the WIPs I've included here is showing a roughly shaded layer for John that I ended up scrapping for the simpler coloring that's in the final version.\nThere were aspects of the more detailed coloring I liked, but I didn't want John to stick out as awkwardly rendered against the otherwise mostly simplistic background style. I had a lot of fun creating this piece and I hope it does the cute song some justice!",

With new drums, strings, electric pianos, a celesta, some synths, and a quiet, somewhat ominous epilogue, it was a doozy. I'm pretty sure the epilogue was inspired by a chord progression in a Sonata Arctica song. Something about the tone and instrumentation of the piece felt right at home with Sonata's synths. The piece is meant to convey both a relaxed and serene feeling on top of a somewhat melancholy and serious undertone. Calliope's void light spiral was a breather from the craziness happening elsewhere in the comic, but there was always the threat of English showing up.",

        "commentary": "<i>Luke Benjamins:</i>\nI actually wrote the melody for this track almost five years ago, for a project that never got off the ground. As far as I can remember, I didn't have any particular inspiration when I wrote it, musical or otherwise. It's the catchiest tune I've ever made, yet I couldn't tell you how it came to me exactly. This version is a completely unique take on this melody compared to the original context, giving it a very different Feel. I wasn't able to do any of the audio production for this track, but I did guide RJ as to how I Feel it should be put together. We ended up pushing the deadline too much with this one, and there are still a couple things I wish had been changed, but like with any creative work, you need to draw the line somewhere, lest you polish it endlessly.\nIn the end, I'm gald to finally share itw ith the world in some form, and I hope the world enjoys it.\n<i>Robert J! Lake:</i>\nThis is really Luke's song. I started the project file but he made it his own. The crow noises are mine.\n(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yngy9XIzRLY&lc=UgheYBDHMQfgt3gCoAEC\">YouTube</a>)\n<blockquote>RJ, if you arranged this piece, then there must be an original you used as a base. Is there some sort of file or sheet for that track?</blockquote>\nluke might have a famitracker file. the way it worked is basically that he wrote the vast majority of the melodic content in famitracker and sent that my way, and i incorporated it as i saw fit. some of it's completely my own - that bassline, and the break section, for instance, as well as the second solo - but most of it comes directly from just a few wavs he shot my way.\nso ask him, is my best advice!\n<i>PJ Tush:</i>\nBeing so high energy, I wanted to make the piece as colorful as possible, but not unattractively saturated. Initially I planned on reflecting the characters in dream bubbles of their respective colors, but decided to depict them in full mugshot instead.\nEach character is lightly engulfed in a colroful overlay in front of the chaotic, perpetually expanding infinity of gay space.\n<i>Fenn:</i>\n<i>Feel</i> is a very powerful song full of energy. We were inspired by the tension filled events occuring during the 3 year span of time between those stuck on the troll meteor, flying through space towards an unknowing and terrifying future.\n<i>Mika B.:</i>\nWhen rendering the final rendition of the track art piece, I hoped to give it a complete finish that would accustom the piece's lovely concept art. I enjoyed working to convey the spectacular energy Jade is known to behold, particularly with her hair.\nOverall, this piece was a great enjoyment to work on, and I was able to accompany two great artists in their work to create art to represent <i>Feel</i>, as well as the teens' spiraling adventure on the gay meteor.",

Hence the accordion. But then, like any other time I started feeling vaguely like making something into a piece for shipping people, I actually made the piece and got a way better idea for what it would be for, aka post-game everyone-hanging-out reflection-relaxation. And hey, the accordion still worked.\nI don't expect anyone else to be a Maria Schneider fan and also encounter this peice, but if they do, yes I pretty much took the first 4 bars of Evanescence and used it as the basis for the piece. A few other cues came from that piece as well.\n<i>Richard Gung:</i>\nA chill tune deserves a classy cover.",

Naturally, I obliged, and I asked him if he had anything specific in mind that he wanted me to draw for it, and he basically told me to draw whatever came to mind. So I listened to the WIP of the track he sent me a few times to get a feel for what I wanted to draw for it, and jotted down a couple of concept sketches for what I wanted to do!\nThe first character that came to mind was Rose for some reaosn, and the track gave me a bit of a Skaianet vibe, so at first I sketched up a little composition featuring the meteor terminal in the Skaianet lab.\nI scrapped that idea because it would've been far too much detail for me to do in less than a week, so I thought I'd do something with Rose making her way towards Jasper's mausoleum, with a view of meteors falling from the sky. After all, a title like Starfall called meteors to mind!\nSo I sketched up that idea and liked it enough to see it through to completion.\nFun fact: Solatrus was surprised that the final track art was so red, because he felt like the music would inspire more blues, but he liked it a lot in the end.\nI always thought it'd be pretty cool to do something for an official album, and I guess that dream came true!\nI'm pretty happy to have had this opportunity to draw something for this album.",

I figured it would be a sweet way to demonstrate the darker, more elegant aspects of the song and its liveliness at the same time.\nI chose to have Kanaya as the lightsource to put a little more of a literal spin on the title-- Rose as Lilith and Kanaya as her starlight.\nJust the two of them in their own little world, sharing a romantic moment!",

At that time it had a runtime of only one minute, so when Volume 10 was being organised I ran with what I had and extended it into the piece featured. I felt that the initial theme has an air of purity, something that lent itself well to the birth of a new world - hence its allocation.\nAt least, that's how I'm justifying it. In reality this can be considered a Calliope piece at heart.\n<i>Seth Massey:</i>\nThis is a realy fantastic song that I'd been rooting for from the start, and when given the chance to do art for it I was intent on making sure it got the beautiful art it deserved.\nWe had very similar ideas for the visual direction, and I think I've done the concept justice.",

One of the many great things about it is all the \"orchestrations\" he does with such a limited palette, and how strong they come through.\nSo strong in fact, that I've wanted to make an orchestrated version for a long time.\nConsider it fully \"Elfmanized\" now. The title is a referenced to the \"THIS FUCKING PUMPKIN\" line from Problem Sleuth.\nFor obvious reasons I decided to drop one of those words when naming this arrangement.\n<i>Worthikids:</i>\nAlex's original request for this art was \"so here's the thing......<br>could u draw the what pumpkin logo....<br>but with an exclamation point instead of a question mark<br>maybe candy corn vampire-problem sleuth could be holding it?\"\nI remember drawing the altered logo all plain by itself and sending that to Alex,\nand he liked that fine,\nbut I was ultimately irked and redid it with candy corn PS a few days later.",

        "commentary": "<i>Seth Pelle:</i>\nOh, hey. Is it the last track already? Man, where did the time go?\nWow. This piece has run through my head more times than any other that I've written for Homestuck. I hadn't been on the music team for very long before I felt motivated to create something in my head that could conceivably serve as a compelling closer to the comic, regardless of whether it ended up actually serving as such. Arguably the most thematically significant musical motifs in the comic - \"Sburban Jungle\", \"Showtime\", \"Skies of Skaia\", and ofcourse, \"Homsetuck\" - would all have their part to play. I first put it down into corporeal form in late 2010 as a full-length piano draft, but it wasn't until four years later that I began working on the final orchestrated version.\nEfforts to complete it over the next couple years were sparse and sporadic at best and fraught with technical issues, but thankfully I managed to make the deadline for the album.\nI wanted to make something that, although perhaps bittersweet, has a definitively happy ending.\nDespite all the super bad stuff that goes down through the course of the comic, Homestuck is ultimately a story with a message of optimism. Learning, growing, helping, loving.\nBlossoming individually, but also working toward a shared goal that's so much bigger than the individual and so totally worth it in the end.\nThese are themes that play out through the entire comic, but also themes that are reflected in our reality.\nI wanted this piece to be an expression of ideals that I, myself, believe in.\nI'm hopeful that you believe in them, as well.\n<i>Kiko B.:</i>\nLook how far we've come! Beatfox did such a spectacular job combining so many early Homestuck themes here. Listening to \"Conclude\" for the first time was a major nostalgia rush!\nIt's a fitting finale to a fantastic album. I went through tons of variations of the same image of John and his friends looking ff into the new world they'd built, but I couldn't quite nail down the concept.\nNothing, no matter how vast in scope, or how many kids I crammed in there, properly conveyed the feeling of finality befitting the final track on the album, and the end of HS itself.\nRealizing that my initial concept was leading me nowhere, I returned to Act 1 for inspiration.\nMy single favorite page in HS is page 82 - the soothing but foreboding sound of wind chimes ringing in the howling breeze might even be my favorite use of sound in the whole comic, period.\nI intentionally set the scene to look a lot like his yard in Act 1, with the \"THANKS FOR PLAYING\" text hanging in the sky as the one distinguishing feature that sets this piece post-Act 7. Here, John isn't gazing forlornly at his neighborhood in the anticipation of a long day, but relaxing somewhere warm and familiar after that long day has finally come to a close.\nBy the way, I haven't forgotten that his ACTUAL yard isn't exactly intact by the end of Act 1, but I figured it was worth it to take a little artistic license to deliver what this track needed.\nIt's not TOO much of a stretch to assume that John or any one of his God Tier pals could have rebuilt his home in the new universe, right?\nRight.\nIt's my headcanon and I won't be shamed!\nOn a final and more personal note, Homestuck, and its music,<br>hold a very special place in my heart.\nI began reading in 2011, so there was a lot of the comic and a lot of music to catch up on. I saved up so I could buy and binge it all at once. My favorite themes fueled many lazy days drawing fanart, which I eagerly shared online. I can sincerely say that doing so changed my life in many ways, as is the case with so many little, seemingly inconsequential decisions. Sharing my enthusiasm for HS led me to meet many dear friends.\nThat's an experience that I think HS encapsulates incredibly well - the incalculable impact something as simple as sharing something with friends can have.\nThis piece is my thank-you to Homestuck for that experience.",

The goal was to basically make something so dramatically epic and life-changing that it would just be incredibly silly. (I believe Hardlyquin ended audibly on a joke sound, while I wanted Revelawesome to be played as straight as possible).\nAnd it was.\nThe music was based on some earlier work I did on an old Sonic Fangame (Completely forget which one - Think it was a boss theme) that I re-tuned for orchestra and gave it more of a buildup.

It was prevalent that a lot of Jade's character was coming from vague aloofness, yet a degree of precognition via dreaming that would prove central to the character and the concept of Sburb.\nThus, it's a playful kind of dream-like melody. A little scatterbrained a quite unusual (Namely due to the time signature which is something like 6/4). I came up with the melody years ago, and it's mostly just playing about on the sharp/flat keys on a keyboard. I generally don't like incorporating it too much because the chord progression sounds a <i>bit</i> too close to Snow Patrol's \"Chasing Cars\" (Which was released way after I originally came up with the melody for BoA, but is infinitely more popular)\nDespite being used in 'The Flash Where Nothing Happens' and also being quite long, it's still one of my closet favourite tracks. So much so I did a remake that never made it to any album because it wasn't really anything new. In any case, it's <a href=\"https://unofficialmspafans.bandcamp.com/track/joy-and-dreams-eternal\">here</a>.\nI then took an enormous break from HS (shortly after doing a Squiddles track that I don't particularly like) and wouldn't be back 'till around about the time of AlternaBound had started being a discussed thing.",

I then put together a larger mix of the tune with shinier production and a glockenspiel tag, and this was the version Andrew used in the end.\n<i>Buzinkai:</i>\nDoctor was written before Homestuck, actually. The only thing I can really remember was that Super Smash Bros Brawl came out right before I finished it. The original loop (which is not the one specifically heard in the comic, but was included in the album release) was directly inspired by music from Cave Story, and I was trying to at the time musically embody how I felt at the time, I think. Though it never seems to come out exactly as I plan it, I enjoyed the results. I will say that I cannot truly believe how many people have remixed it.\nThe arpeggio part at the end goes between the left, both, and right speakers sequentially. I was too lazy to set the channel settings manually, so I did each note on a different instrument, which is set to each speaker channel. Not many people know that, and I think it actually made it a living hell for remixers who got a hold of the original file.",

        "commentary": "<i>James Roach:</i>\n(Chahut's theme)\na little over three years ago i was in a sweaty conference room in manhattan visiting the now defunct WP NYC studio (which was in a shared space sort of... tech venture situation??) sitting in on what was usually a remote meeting. I nervously stood in front of andrew and my director at the time (whos name was also james come to think of it) as well as a handful of other people. Toby was conference calling in like we both usually did.\nThey said since i was visiting from out of town I didn't have to present anything at this weeks meeting like i usually did. I said I had something to show them anyway, since I didn't like to sit around idly and wanted to make the most of my studio visit. I stood there half-moist with gross air-dampness only new york in summer can really provide knowing I had one opportunity to wow them in person.\n\"alright. remember all those sound effects for that highblood minigame? like... seltzer water? light bulb? honks? squeaks? ok well, I made them into a beat and added some airhorns and tuba-\"\n\"more tuba?\" said toby over the call\n\"hell yeah brother more tuba\"\nanyway this was that song. It was going to be for a minigame sequence but i wanted to use it here. originally it didn't have a melody so i wrote a melody on banjo since you should definitely be reading all of chahuts lines in a very slow, methodical louisiana genteel southern accent. \"SANGLE and ready tuh MANGLE\"",

I have been saying saying \"boyo\" a lot lately. oh god is the lad.... me??? no probably not.\nthis song started off as a track for my best friend at the time Lexxy's fantroll very creatively named \"Lexxer\" back before homestuck fantrolls were \"post-ironic\" and still \"sincere.\" I also put the melody to \"nuclear\" in here as a throwback to my old fantroll \"Carcha.\" I have said fantroll more times today than I have in the last year. Fantroll.\nthis is the closest to ska that friendsim has got just because in its original iteration this is a weird like... electronica ska song.\nanyway i say it \"started off\" as that but i literally wrote this track on like.. monday. thats how ya boy do. I borrowed from a song i wrote for a fantroll album i did. theres a whole fantroll album that... hasn't really stood up to the passing of time so I've mostly purged it from existence. I guess some chuckleheads found it but have been kind enough not to repost it.",

The important characters got more or less morphed into Marsti as we know her now.\nThere is a whole like section of the game where this melody is used a lot. Its in the old 3D hiveswap trailer, in the Homestuck 2.0 video. Wow. All the cursed ones. It is explicitly not a leitmotif because it is not meant to be \"..indicative of a person or place\" it is just a theme.\nwait but... if i make it marsti's theme does that not mean it, however inadvertently, is now a person's theme and therefore IS a leitmotif? aw jeez guys i really beefed it this time.\nthis ones a bit older but this is, once again, just another example of me goin ham on bass for no good fuckin reason. i just think it sounds cool what do you want from me.",

In ACT 1, the song \"Keep your head down\" has a rhythmic motif that I use in the climax of this song. I wont tell you what its for but... think of whats happening during that song in ACT 1, and know that it will be a much bigger deal when you eventually see it. i don't have any information wrt \"when\" that would be helpful to you. its barely even helpful to me. a real \"buddy, they dont even let ME fuck the flag\" situation. this is a reference to a popular tweet. im not an insane person i swear.\nanyway nihkees sprite is absolutely fucking ripped. the size of this lad. the A in LGBTQA+ stands for ABSOLUTE UNIT apparently.\nI know it does not please do not @ me i am so fucking tired.",

It was an incredible opportunity with a lot of ups and downs and emotional significance. it will probably continue to be that. I had a lot of fun doing all of this for you. it also… ate up a LOT of my time, though. I have been on a nonstop homestuck train for like the last five years and only now that i’ve gotten into the groove of things its ending again. bittersweet. for now.\ni don’t really know how to feel but i hope i at least wrote a song or two you liked along the way.\nheres the one for MC/DOC SCRATCH that i think is my favorite from the whole thing. its based off a song from an old (bad) fantroll album i did in like 2011 (and the song was written even earlier than that) that i have since purged from the internet as best i can. thank you for not reposting it. i re-used a lot of assets from it for other stuff. i was in a real weird place when i made it so aside from it being kinda bad i just… don’t wanna see it ever LMAO.\nthat album made the homestuck music community real mad at me because they thought i was getting preferential treatment for being popular on-line and friendly with some WP staff on twitter. my unofficial album got approved for sale and at the same time, completely unknown to me someone on the music team’s album didn’t get approved. a handful of them used this incident to talk shit about me for several years. one of them made fun of me for my dad passing away?? yikes. most of us have made our peace (i understand how easy it is to get caught up in dog-piling on a common enemy or w/e) but theres still one or two that are like… still real mad at me for this percieved slight. they’ll say like “you were rude to us” and its like… you guys… literally made fun of me for not having a family i’m not sure what you want from me.\nthis one got away from me. anyway. thanks for listening. stop being weird to me on twitter. tip your waitstaff.",

It's based off of where the trolls lived before starting their game, with Meenah having run away to the pink moon while everyone else is on Beforus, as well as my track art for [[Cosmic Malfunction]] by Ducky Senpai, which also has to do with people chilling on space orbs. It was really hard to find a balance with all these guys, while at the same time knowing it has to represent the entire album and all of the people working on it.

They are not particularly exciting in and of themselves, so instead I'll speak a little about Disc 1 itself. Disc 1 is the part of the album initially designed to contain the twelve \"principal tracks\", invisaged as the main theme for each of the twelve Beforan trolls. At the start of the project, musicians could actually reserve these spots, but a lot of shuffling happened towards the end. Eventually, each troll ended up having multiple themes on the album, but Disc 1 still contains what can probably be considered their \"main\" theme, due to its location at the start of the album. With only twelve tracks and the short bookend piece, Disc 1 is far smaller than the longer Disc 2 section.\n<i>Elanor Pam:</i>\nThis is the third artwork I completed for the project, and once again it ended up being a broup shot-- this time at the mod's request. Since it was the introductory artwork for Disc 1, it felt appropriate to me to depect them on the place where it all started, where Meenah claimed to have found the game after running away from her duties: the Pink Moon. And where the game is, so there must be a Frog Temple. Right?",

        "commentary": "<i>Neon Zenith:</i>\nThis work was originally intended as a simple cover for a competition on battleofthebits.org. To make it more unique, I took some inspiration from a song by maxvdubs and wrote some original lyrics; originally they were written about the plot of Dark Souls and the frustrating sense of hopelessness within. When considering what sort of song to make for this album, I realised how well the lyrics seemed to resonate with the story of Damara Megido, and adapted them accordingly. I also recently created an introductory segment (based on the pre-chorus and chorus of the song) intended to depict a sort of inner turmoil as one enters a dark period of their life and is confronted with various emotions including despair, horror, and hatred.\nThe name of the song refers to the concept of rpedetermination and fate. Damara's wiki page notes that she holds \"much fatalism and frustration\" within herself; considering that I had named the set of Souls-themed lyrics \"Frustration,\" it felt somewhat fitting that \"Fatalism\" be its counterpart. Note that although the lyrics are mostly directed towards Damara, the second and third stanzas of the second verse refer to the Handmaiden and her service to Lord English. (Many thanks to my friend Chris for helping me better understand the plot details.)\n<i>Amelia G.:</i>\nDrawing this piece and listening to Neon Zenith's song really made me look at Damara differently. I wanted to highlight the inner turmoil that people tend to look over, adding the Handmaiden to show those feelings that she hides. Damara is an incredibly interesting character, and I was just telling someone that I don't draw enough Megidos.",

        "commentary": "<i>Rhyselinn:</i>\nHi! I'm Rhyselinn, the composer for Rufioh Nitram's track \"Breathtak1ng.\"\nI admit, I had difficulty trying to categorize the Nitrams' music while doing research for this track. By my best estimation, Breathtak1ng is an upbeat flamenco/salsa hybrid. It includes excerpts from (in approximate order): [[Do The Windy Thing]], [[dESPERADO ROCKET CHAIRS,]] [[Bronze Rebel]], [[iRRRRRRRRECONCILA8LE]], and [[Savior of the Waking World]]. (And the ending is reminiscent of [[Infinity Mechanism]], for whatever that's worth.)\nThe middle section also includes excerpts from [[The Lost Child]], a Damara Megido song, and some machinery noises in homage to Horuss Zahhak. Rufioh's character arc in Openbound focuses heavily on his romantic entanglements with these two characters, so I wanted Breathtak1ng to emphasize Rufioh's nature as a freedom-oriented Breath player, and portray him breaking free of these toxic attachments. As a result, the two interludes feel darker and less energetic to contrast the moment iRRRRRRRRECONCILA8LE kicks in. That's when Rufioh metaphorically spreads his wings, breaks free of those binding attachments, and is finally able to fly and succeed in the most amazing, breathtaking way.\n<i>doodlebonez:</i>\nThe idea for this art was to have Rufioh flying away from the ones who have made his life hard. The papers flying about are meant to be seen as him finally pursuing what he loves. Ideally I would have loved to have him fly into the sun, but as I imagined him as being alive rather than dead, this was not ideal.",

        "commentary": "<i>psithurist:</i>\nI was asked to make a track as a theme for Mituna, so my first thoughts were 1. chip sounds and 2. guitars. The first draft of the track was a lot more chaotic, with the melodies being played on live guitars, and it didn't really work out, so most of it ended up being cut - only a couple of backing guitar tracks amde it onto the final piece. The title and theme of this track is based on a (somewhat infamous) fan theory, which speculates that Mituna's injuries come from him burning out whilst using his psiionic powers to propel Prospit's moon from the alpha trolls' session into another, allowing the remaining living trolls to use its quest beds to go god tier. I don't know if that idea will pan out at all, but I thought it was interesting enough to write a song about! I hope that you think so too!\n<i>slitherbot:</i>\nfor the track art i decided that i should depict mituna looking almost as if hes using his psiionics! in the design  iwanted to use a pixelly pattern which i thought went along with the chiptune sound of the song, also i listened to the song on repeat while making it!! i apologize the whole picture itself is really eye strain-y but i thought it would fit!",

        "commentary": "<i>Blackhole:</i>\nCivil Discussi9n was my first purposeful musical contribution to the album! I wanted to produce a track that captured the feeling of Kankri's self-assured snobbery and pseudo-intellectualism as it was presented in his first appearance in Openbound, but from his own perspective. I imagine the feel of the track is rather what Kankri thinks of himself in his crusade for social justice. The structure of the melody was inspired by certain works of baroque classical music, although I can hardly have been said to have stuck to any one particular convention! The track was originally intended to be modified somewhat, but due to technical issues I lost the progress file for it! Hoewver I didn't want to see what I had to waste, and I believe that the track stands up solidly on its own in its current form. I hope you think so too!\n<i>Taylor Leong:</i>\nFor this piece, I was thinking particularly about how the track is meant to be how Kankri views himself within the greater context of Beforan society. I thought that the classical Baroque influences in the music really reflected the rigid pseudo-benevolent social strucutre and pretensions within Beforan society that Kankri seeks to criticize and improve upon, albeit in his own flawed way. Visually, I drew influences from various religious artworks, including Medieval iconography as well as the Baroque paintings of Caravaggio, referencing both Kankri and the Sufferer's roles as a play on traditional literary Christ figures. Overall, Kankri takes himself extremely seriously, and the track art reflects that self-image in the form of a somber, messianic martyr heroically withstanding the persection of people triggering and encroaching upon his personal space.",

Matesprits Osculate Gleefully<br>(EpiMOG: Milord's Onerous Gift)\nThis song begins by echoing Nine Lives, One Love sound but this version of Meulin Leijon is much happier and offbeat by nature. Like 9L1L, it's also in 9/8 time and the opening bells tap out the morse code for MOG. The second part starts suddenly as she \"meets\" a peculiar purpleblood... one Kurloz Makara. The organ is prominent but also lots of whimsical synth sounds to suggest he's an entertainer but with a more sinister side. The cymbals tap out 10 hits as Makaras are the tenth troll on the list from low to highbloods. A slow romantic transition follows, reintroducing the Leijon bells over Makara's organ sounds and then into the third section, where the heavy drums pound out a heartbeat for the Mage of Heart and you can hear voices for both Kurloz's seductive whispers and Meulin's joyous song. As she falls asleep in his arms, he too begins to dream... the chiming bells signal the arrival of the Vast Honk and the tinnitus that recedes into Meulin's deafened silence.\n<i>felicitousArtisan:</i>\nI've always found Meulin slightly unsettling, so I was pleased to be assigned art duty on a track that explores all facets of the character, rather than just \"she's cute and likes cats!\". Meulin happily ships and memes her way through a surprisingly tragic life; she's fine that Kurloz deafened her, she's oblivious that he's mind-controlling her. I wanted to reflect that with a smiling mouth and eyes full of stars and the beauty of it all, but a sense of emptiness and loss as the Vast Honk obliterates her hearing and she's left with a meaningless future. Sorry, that's pretty nihilistic, but so is Meulin!",

Admittedly I wrote this song less about Aranea's story and more about a folktale called the spider's thread, which ironically ties into Aranea's story well. I'm not gonna go into details about the folk tale but basically Aranea has a spider theme (obviously) and she came out of a pseudo hell by clinging to a small hope, only for her selfish desires to drop her back where she came from. Man none of this was really about the music aspect, uh, I wrote the song in 4-5 days. That's cool I guess.\n<i>HermesNitram:</i>\nI intended to stay faithful to Aranaea's arc and showed her nature through the clothes and facial expressions she wears in \"Homestuck\". The whole piece was inspired by the theme of spider - how it spins a web through the story, trapping and ensnaring others in the plot, but, if lost, might end up trapping itself in the cobweb. The string figure made from the necklace she wears is called \"The Hangman's Trick.\" It was heavily inspired by the bouncy theme of the music. It shows how she has trapped others (portrayed by paper dolls, a callback to wooden dolls of regeneration and French Pantins, otherwise known as jumping jacks), and herself in it: one wrong move and she'll be left hanging! Of course, one cannot forget about the visualization of the Light aspect, the immortal sun - both holding and being trapped by the web, just like Aranea herself.",

With the appearance of a juggalo, mime and skeleton combined, how could he not? He's apparently calm but creepy or terrifying and boisterous depending on who he's talking to, which is something I wanted to emulate in this track with the contrast between the first section and everything afterwards. However, his true, clownish nature shines at the end, when he takes the last resolving note hostage then rubs it in your face. What a rascal.\nThis went through a few (very incomplete) iterations before I finished it, mainly because I wasn't sure where to start expressing Kurloz's character; in the end I combined melodies from different versions to make the final product. It's neat how music can work that way!\n(P.S The Morse code sounds out \"HONK\". Because of course.)\n<i>Robin:</i>\nI really liked the idea of Kurloz and puppets, and obviously, you need strings to move puppets. From the thought of puppets, to strings, to the red string of faith. And yknow, a string for each finger equals to five strings. It reminded me of piano and such, so from that I just put on some notes onto the bloody strings. Pun intended.",

It has similarities to [[Hate You]], which I considered a primary inspiration, though I also drew inspiration from the Splatoon soundtrack for the opening section.\n\"Killer Beach\" explores Meenah's love of gold and cash, as well as her malicious tendencies, to aspects we see throughout the latter half of Act 6, including her brief romance with Vriska. You might note the Megalovania reference in the ending guitar. Coupled with Rex Duodecim Angelus (their session's defeat of the Black King) and English (her alternate self's employment by Lord English), this piece covers Meenah in her entirety.\nAt the end, Meenah is reflecting. She sees herself as evil. Reminded of her final moments in her session, as she detonates the bomb sending all of them as ghosts into the Farthest Ring, she severs ties with Vriska, and returns to lead an army.\n<i>Rangzhe:</i>\nI wanted to reflect on what the musician wanted to portray Meenah on the track, but also my ideas of Meenah's similarity in personality with her Alternian counter-part, the Condesce. I put a little more of my own idea that Meenah not realizing how much she is like the Condesce even when hearing and at awe about her accomplishments and her magnificent ruling style from Aranea. I also put lime green as the background color not only to match up the complimentary color but to also symbolize LE's employment of the Condesce. She is a lot more like her Alternian self than she realizes... 38)",

        "commentary": "<i>Blackhole:</i>\nDisc 2 is the longest Disc in Beforus. Unlike Disc 1, which consists of individual themes for each of the trolls, Disc 2 is a narrative depiction of their story. Each song, be it a theme for a particular aspect of a character, a soundtrack for a particular event, or else a scene-setting piece, has been arranged so that Disc 2 roughly forms a narrative story in chronological order, which can hopefully be seen in the music and artwork.\nBecause this was not specifically the intention from the start, and because some tracks have been arranged in particular awys due to reasons other than theanarrative order (such as when track art depictions do not fit the original order), in some places the placement of tracks is not perfect, or at the very least might be debated. Overall however I think Disc 2 forms a relatively complet, in depth and coherent tale in musical form, and it was definitely my favourite part of the album to put together.\n<i>Lovisa Lassen:</i>\nThe tracks on Disc 2 follow a narrative approach to the story of the Beforus trolls and I wanted to show that by using dream bubbles, which contain the memories of the dead. And I got to draw a horrorterror, so there's that too. I like horrorterrors.",

All we had been told so far was that the Sufferer had been inspired to rebel by his memories of a peaceful world-- so that was what I set out to convey: the idyllic memories of a paradise planet, as well as the sadness of its loss and the tense hostility of the present. It's actually a fairly simple track, made in Sibelius with nothing but built-in instruments and ambient sounds, but I've grown to like it a lot. (People who are into brazilian folk songs can probably feel the influence here.)\n<i>Sallidido:</i>\nI chose the three trolls that I did because they had the biggest impacts on the sufferer's life, so adding their less violent and warmer counterparts was the comparison, but I added the whole gang in another version because I wasn't quite sure you woulda ccept it with only 3 beforus characters. I listened to the song you sent quite a few times and the background was based on it. (I got the general barren but soft vibe from it?) It was a lot of fun, though a bit difficult and stressful as midnight approached, and figuring out placement and what I wanted to do with everything was a bit hard. The background is based on what we have seen fo beforus/alternia, and I wanted to make its ofter to fit a bit better with the music. (I love the composer's work by the way!)",

Overall, I tried to capture the feeling of flying through space and leaving everything stressful behind. As far as structure, the beginning part represents Meenah starting to feel better, but still holding back a bit on good feels. Then, after the drop represents when she finally lets go of everything that once troubled her. The song ends similar to how it started to sort of foreshadow her return to power in the end. Funny story: the song started out with a 4/4 time signature. When I made the drop, I was making it in 6/8 without really realizing it, and then after I figured it out, I rewrote the beginning part to fit the new signature, and it felt so much smoother and better. And that's how I found out about time signatures :P\n<i>Danna Vital:</i>\nI've actually never drawn Meenah before and at first I was a little nervous but as soon as I heard the song I got very inspired and came up with a bunch of concept sketches. I decided to go with this image because I think it stayed true to that feeling the song gives you of being free and letting go. Hope you enjoy!",

The piece was played live on a piano and then edited in Audacity.\n<i>Josefin B.:</i>\nMy inspiration for this piece was old paintings of mermaids and sirens. I wanted to make the serene, ethereal feeling created by the track, making Feferi look regal while also friendly and playful, as if you caught her outside of her queenly duties. The colours are meant to evoke an underwater feeling, but also a sense of her being supernatural. This image is made completely with watercolours on printer paper; a choice I made to get the convex texture. Ths was honestly such a fun piecea nd I'm so glad I got to make the track art for the lovely track Radiant Imperatrix.",

This song's alternate name in my own album is \"La Tauromaquia,\" meaning \"bullfighting\" in Spanish.\n<i>rockytoad:</i>\nWhen I was figuring out what th draw for the song, I did pay attention to the song's name and also alternate name. Hearing \"weeaboo\" made me want to put kitty ears on Rufioh, but I scrapped that idea and instea dfocussed on the bullfighting aspect of the song first and foremost. Since Rufioh is kind of a silly character, I thught that it'd be great to gie him one of those little pony riding sticks with a bull for the head. After I finished drawing the main part of the drawing, I was still trying to figure out how to incorporate \"weeaboo\"-ness into it. Well, weeaboo makes me think of kitties and anime, so my mind went to Nyan Cat. Perfect, I thought, I'll add some Goold Ol' Nyan Cat rainbows, haha. And then, of course, glitter becaus anime.

Nevertheless, this song is meant to be like a ballad, but I'll leave the detailed interpretation of the story it tells up to you, the listenre, and your presumably adept imagination.\n<i>Kayson Spinazzola:</i>\nThe inspiration for this piece is surpisingly straight-forward. When I listened to the music, this was the picture that popped into my head, no matter how many imtes I played the song, so the direction was clear. Besides that; I can't imagine Meenah looking anything but exactly like this while downloading the game.",

Beforus looms in front of us as we slowly zoom in on the planet itself, when, at the critical moment, we cut to Meenah and the gang. As they desperately avoid getting killed in the Cataclysm, their path to the Medium is laid bare. Once there, they go through their trials, from locating their denizens, to frog breeding, and to the required ectoplasmic shenanigans.\nBut when it becomes clear that their sesison is bound for a Scratch, Meenah is forced to make a terrible decision.\n<i>Lovisa Lassen:</i>\nFor Beforus was about the doomed nature of the session and I wanted to show it with a picture of the instrument for scratching the session, the big music box in the Land of Quartz and Melody, and the Quills of Echidna, the means of creating the scratch. The track starts out very positively, and I wanted to includ ethat hopefulness by adding more characters in the picture that as of yet don't feel the threat of the failing session looming over them.",

Perhaps because I finally had so many options and tolls at my disposal, this track was by far the hardest for me to realize, not helped by the fact that it was originally a theme for my favorite character, Karkat. I wanted it to be perfect! Or at least awesome! This perfectionism meant I could never settle on what I wanted. Over the years I kept coming back to it, tweaking here, poking there, always feeling like it was incomplete (or perhaps over done); in the end I shaved off several bars, redid the percussion line and tweaked velocity until I cried uncle. Is it better know? I don't know! It's been looping for so long I can't even tell anymore...\n<i>Rebecca Peason:</i>\nThis song definitely brings me the image of the Land of Pulse and Haze, but in kind of a chill meandering kind of way. It feels more like some kind of exploration than a time sensitive game track to me. So I wanted to try to get that feeling, appreciate the landscape and have a Vantas presence but an ambiguity to who it is exploring this landscape. I also wanted to go with something that looked more like it came from the cmoic than some other pieces. I know I'm quite pleased with the result and had a lot of fun. I wouldn't mind revisiting some other lands in future pieces.",

It was made as a march because marches signify authority and Kankri attempts to command the respect of his fellow teammates throughout his session. The faster parts represent that his calm demeanor can be easily shattered by his short temper. I used piano and violin to connect it to the song that I had made ealrier for Porrim called \"Antevo+rta.\" This song's alternate name in my own album is \"The Pariah.\"\n<i>ARTistotel:</i>\nThe idea behind the picture was tightly tied to the piece itself, and author's descrption. Kankri is trying to be a leader, but all his protection falls back on the civilization long lost and destroyed - taht's why it's Beforan skulls marching right after him. His leadership, his protection is aimed more at dusty pieces and bits of no longer existing Beforan society, rather than his friends in afterlife.",

It all sort of originated with a wager, that I couldn't produce a better Tavros song than the one on the official album. And of course, being the huge procrastinator that I am, I never did. But I did however get the idea to do my own album for the songs of the Beforan Trolls. Again, procrastination got the better of me, but this project came along and almost took the workload I had give nmyself off my shoulders and still gave me an opportunity to showcase what I had done for Damara. It does have the traditional Eastern Asian sound to it with the pentatonic scale, and that's what the song was based upon. Also ghosts. Because spoopy.\n<i>JulietCee:</i>\nI wanted to reflect the sort of spooky feel of the track in this piece, so I thught \"what better way to do it than drawing The Scratch, with all those flashing blue lights?\" It was a lot of fun to draw, and I like drawing Damara.\n<i>Blackhole:</i>\n(Blackhole here! Just dropping in to point out that, as the Witch of Time, it does make sense that Damara would have the only achronological track art of Disc 2! I suppose she's getting ahead on the timeline action by jumping back to earlier in the session. The Scratch is yet to come!)",

Horuss for me, despite his humorous characterisation, has always had this sort of aura about him, this cloud of smoke and steam - a sort of sense of an industrial force wrapped up in this one, lonely individual. His steam automata and his manner, naturally brooding beneath the forced cheerful exterior, almost feel like Equius but somehow more mature, with more gravitas. I tried to put all that into this track. It's a lot more slow moving and atmospheric than my usual work. I imagine a steam engine locomotive building up speed, slow but inexorable, and impossible to stop once unerway. Fun fact; free steam samples are hard to find. Aside from the one locomotive sound effect I did manage to source, most of the pneumatic hiss you hear is in fact me blowing on my microphone.\n<i>Cakelets:</i>\nWhen I heard this track the first thing that came to me was an industrial vibe so I tried to stick with that impression by adding the steam and darker colros coupled with the bright orange. This piece was also very atmospheric so I tried to emulate that by having the smoke almost engulfing Horuss as well as adding the fkecls of black to represent oil and further the industrial feel of the piece. I hope you all can look at this art along with the music and see the more mature and thoughtful side of Horuss.",

I took inspiration from the official \"The Wanderers\" album, one of my favorite albums in the Homestuck discography. I was particularly inspired by the album's electronic and Arabic kind of style, which definitely fits the theme of a desert-like landscape in the ruins of a technologically advanced civilization.\nIn this case, I envisioned Beforus' \"years in the future\" scenario as being not quite as refined as the Midnight Crew's city, since I kind of doubt the Beforan trolls would have enough teamwork to bother exiling them, but with much more room to build upon than pre-Scratch Earth since the Red Miles and Bec Noir ruined any potential our original exiles had. So the buildup of this song really represents the growth of the Beforan exiles (whoever they may be) and their community itself!\n(Of course, there's still the issue of Spades Slick eventually shooting a bullet and destroying the entire universe... yikes. Guess they can worry about that later...?)\n<i>Neiratina:</i>\nI've always liked the juxtaposition between photography and illustrations drawn on top of them, especially creatures and critters interacting with everyday objects as if they were part of our routine, something unseen but still among us. For this piece, I wanted to create something similar, but with a little twist. I wanted both worlds to fuse and be a part of each other. And to answer the \"what ifs\" by presenting another question: what if, years in the future (but not many) our own universe becomes their reality?",

I wasn't all too successful, and I often don't ever finish projects. Once I saw news of the fan album, it gave me reason to create a track. This track was a twice failed and shelved project. It finally bloomed into what it is now. Really I just want to thank the Beforus team for having me here. THis endeavor really gave me hope and reason behind my production. This is my first major step into the realm of music production. Shout out to Xavier, you're like a brother to me.\n<i>Lovisa Lassen:</i>\nFor Skaia Ad Infinitum I wanted to include the classic spirograph defense portal symbol (in purple as opposed to the Alternia trolls' blue ones, for its symbolism) and Skaia itself, while also showing some tidbits of the Beforus trolls' session of Sgrub that we know about through the portal, since the track is about Skaia watching over the session. As the track art took on a center focused composition I also included the planets and moons of the session, and it also tied it back to Skaia again with it in the center.",

Whilst I originally billed it as a Jasprose theme when she made her debut, for Beforus I've repurposed it as a more general sprite theme that would work for the Beforan session sprites.

        "commentary": "<i>RowBird:</i>\nThis song was composed with the intent of having a \"Homestuck\" feel to it, while being my own creation at the same time. The floating left-hand chord pattern that is heard throughout the song is inspired by [[Flare]], and [[Three in the Morning]]. The piano portion was composed before I even knew of the fan album, so it was mostly in the additional elements (the strings, woodwinds, percussion, etc.) that the character was shaped.\nAs the track progressed, I began to see more and more elements of Rufioh in it. The track follows Rufioh's storyline in that, at the beginning, it is calm and simple, reflecting his life before sGrub and his relationship with Damara. As the tension mounts in the drumline, we discover his feelings for Horuss and the beginnings of his fights with Damara as the strings kick in. The gradual crescendo to the end shows the challenges he faces during the game and the desparation to save the world how he knows it. As his life ends, he reflects back on it, wondering if he could have made other choices to have kept this from happening.\n<i>Neiratina:</i>\nThe real challenge about illustrating this song was the fact that it depicted so many different emotions I couldn't just choose one to stand out from all the rest. Together, they spoke of a lifetime summed up in one melody. In the end, I felt like it was a revelation: the experience of having your life flash before your eyes. \"The Explored Ruins\" doesn't necessarily need to be referring to a physical place, I realized. What about the ruins of your own existence?\nSince both Damara and Horuss played such important roles in Rufioh's life, I really wanted to include them in what ended up being not so metaphorical objects: the roses, representing passion but also strangling, hurting love; and the arrows, symbolizing a new union and a new direction. Yet, in the end, everything fades away with one last Breath. How suitable.",

Written in 6/8 time (Maryams are 6th on the hemospectrum, Serkets the 8th), this piece reflects the affairs between the jade and ceruleanbloods of the Homestuck story: short but passionate. The song suggests an invitation to dance; the initial hesitation of the cymbals show, in this case, Aranea's feelings of uncertainty in the presence of an experienced byt ukind red romancer in Porrim but, over time, she learns to trust the jadeblood and allows herself to be led into a brief but intense concupiscent relationship.\n<i>Danna Vital:</i>\nI contacted Dallas as aoon as I got this track assigned to me, he's been a part of the creative process since the beginning and I think in the end we got an art piece that shows how complex yet romantic and passionate the relationships between the Maryams and Serkets can be which is exactly what we were both going for, hope you enjoy!",

That a Sylph of Light could have \"looked into the future\" and decided getting comfy with our dear Maid of Space was the right course of action for a time... it caught my interest, and fanned my love for this pairing. I was originally considering writing something more lively, like an instruental sea shanty, but I decided that solace fit the two best. I imagine it wasn't a loud or busy relationship, and so neither is the track. My concurrent goal was the ncourage listeners to look into the future themselves. Just a track to take a breath to, look at the sky to, contemplate. At the very least, to imagine this pair doing so, in their time together. I wonder what pulled them apart?\n<i>Cakelets:</i>\nThis track is really a soft and soothing melody so I wanted to use a soft and soothing color pallet. I also really wanted to focus on Aranea and Porrim since the piece was written about their fling. I really love quiet music so as soon as I heard the song I knew I wanted to make an image that was more on the simple side with cool colors to evoke the feeling of serenity. I hope you can look at the art with the song and feel the tranquility I was trying to get across!",

I've made music before relating to a similar topic ([[Void Session]]), but that was more relevant to the alpha kids. The functions and mechanics of Sburb has always been one of the most facinating aspects of the Homestuck universe to me, so it's always fun to explore that inspiration.\n<i>Gilwing:</i>\nThe challenge here was to depict the glitch in the session itself, which is a pretty vague concept; the alpha trolls' ectobiology took place after the scratch, they weren't born in their own session. This is also Lord English's calling card, which is represented by the orb kinda looking like Scratch's head depicting the ectobiology lab in universe A2. I originally wanted to include all the trolls in the piece, but it was way too cluttered so I just went with their colors instead. I didn't want the whole thing to be about Kankri since this is about a game concept in general, but the reason I used him was becuase to my (questionable) knowledge, he probably would've been the ectobiologist if their session wasn't glitched, like Karkat. This was definitely a challenge but I'm honored to illustrate for such an incredible track!",

Its name comes from the goddess of childbirth and prophecy, Antevorta, whose alternate name is Porrima.

Porrim's character is more thematic than it is concrete, and such an open-ended premise left me chasing down a few false starts in the piece's design. The failure of Porrim's role as maid of space nonetheless contributed to events on a massive scale. Ignition does not mean success.

I ws listening to coloUrs and mayhem and I was just like \"these would work well together.\" The beginning of the track is how the \"accident\" (read: damara's insatiable fury) happened, going on to Horuss and Rufioh building a relationship as he worked on the latter's body, which devolved into Rufioh's eternal, depressing grind through a mundane life, dating a guy he lost admiration for after the initial spark faded.\n<i>Robin:</i>\nThe idea for this drawing was that I just really wanted to draw Damara and Rufioh meeting up after his head's been placed ona robot horse. Nothing much really! I've always had a soft spot for Megidos so adding her in was absolutely necessary.",

This track was the one that hung around in concept the longest of any of my tracks, but came together the last of them. The original idea was to explore Horuss' own introspections, but that alone wsn't compelling me nearly enough. In the end, connecting Damara's and Horuss' struggles in one musical trainwreck was what propelled me forward. Rufioh takes a back seat to the insecurities and raw emotion of his past and present lovers, existing in tandem. I get the feeling that the session itself weighed heaviest on these two, one doomed to undo it at every turn, and the other to be swallowed up whole in pieces of hismelf. I aimed to convey this through the uncanny, grating musical landscape of the track. It is probably my favorite of the bunch.\n<i>magnoliajades:</i>\nOne of my first thoughts while I was sketching this piece was the silly nature homestuck tends to express even in its more conflicting parts of story. Capturing that light-heartedness was a goal, and doing so while staying true to the track's ominous tone became a challenge. Hopefully together, they give off a \"Calm before the storm\" vibe. Admittingly, re-listening to this track after I finished making art for it made it sound cooler than it already was.",

The vibraphone represetns Damara and her actions, the bell-like sounds showing how fragile she is feeling, while the loud, brash chords of the marimba shows Meenah's incessant cruelty. The final chord, or more accurately, cluster of notes, is Damara's final snap. It is the thing breaking inside her leading her to attack Meenah and Rufioh. The title \"With the Fishes\" has a dual meaning in this case: the obvious meaning of Damara interacting with Meenah, and that \"sleping with the fishes\" is a phrase that signifies that someone's dead, which seemed appropriate since Damara's experiences have left her almost dead inside. I hope you all enjoy this piece!\n<i>VT Stark:</i>\nI wanted to really capture Damara's pre-snap personality here. She's got orange cloth over her eyes, representing how she feels she's been blind regarding what Rufioh has been up to. Meenah's hand is holding onto her throat, yet Damara remains oddly tranquil. SHe's fighting to work through all of this no matter how much it hurts. But in the end, she can only hold on so much for so long. And that's when the expression is less peaceful, more internally dead.",

Damara ends up killing Meenah (the section around 2:08), who is saved by Aranea (the final round), carrying her to her Quest Cocoon so she can Get the Tiger (the ending section). Damara and Aranea don't really have canonised themes, so I composed my own motif for Damara, and referenced Fuchsia Ruler for Meenah, and Killed by BR8K Spider!!!!!!!! for Aranea (technically a Vriska theme, but they're both spider girls, gimme a 8r8k ;;;;) ). I actually started writing this track without a theme in mind, only really knowing it was going to be a battle theme, so the working title was \"beforan beatdown\". The whole track uses original synth sounds made with Magical8BitPlug and NES VST, except the drums, which are sampled from Secret of Mana, and the piano.\n<i>Rebecca Peason:</i>\nI always found Damara's sudden madness very interesting. By all accounts, she used to be a sweet girl until finally snapping and fighting Meenah. Aranea's involvement, however, has always been interesting to me. She, of course, brought Meenah to a quest bed, but I always wanted to explore the ambiguity of her involvement. Whether it was just to drag Meenah away or a decision to nudge along a friend suffering in silence to take action, who can really say. A bloody battle, a bully beaten, and a girl freed from her silence. I wanted this piece to show Aranea's ambiguous involvement and the terror that Damara had become.",

The unexpected harmonies and chord changes grab your attention and keep you listening until the very end. It was a lot of fun to  be able to record the cello solo for this song.

So I thought, what if the whole session was made into an 8-bit NES game? This tune is the on cellosupposed theme of the final stage of BEFORUS: The Game. Or something. Sorry, I suck at names.\nThe song roughly covers the session from Damara intiiating the Scratch to the creation of Alternia. Can you guys see what part of the story is conveyed in each part of the track?\nI used FamiTracker to make the legitimate 8-bit sound. \"Hate You\" by Toby \"Radiation\" Fox and \"Alternia\" by Seth \"Beatfox\" Peelle (\"Theme\" by Toby \"Radiation Fox\") was used in the track. I had a great time making this song, and I hope you guys enjoy it too! :)\n<i>oxfordroulette:</i>\nI tried to make this image like some kind of classy high-res 8-bit shoutout to match with the song.

For the sad part, it's just sad chords. For the mysterious parts, I used a lot of mysterious arpeggios and delay effects. For the Scratch, I used a lot of bitcrush, dramatic arpeggios, and I reused chords from the sad part and arpeggios from the mysterious parts because the Scratch is mixing things. I was inspired by the music of Steven Universe for the style of mysterious arpeggios. I think the music of the series did a great job with how they represent dangerous mystical stuff. I created all the sounds with NI Massive, used Replika for delay and Decimort for bitcrush. I had a lot of fun doing these songs and I hope that you liked it!\n<i>Scarodactyl:</i>\nI was really happy wit hthis song from when I first put on this song and heard the slow, ominous opening. I think it really captures the sense of dread and mystery that surrounds the Scratch. Though the song has a three-part structure, visually I wanted to focus on the event itself. We only briefly see this in the comic, and it's a very striking scene. It was a lot of fun to draw the gigantic music box at the center of everything, and the various lighting effects were an interesting challenge.",

        "commentary": "<i>Dallas Ross Hicks:</i>\nCronus Ampora is in love with the 1950's era of Earth but wishes he could be in love with somebody. Anybody. This song captures the style of music from that time, starting with Cronus's generally pleasant mood but giving way to his overbearing on-the-make obnoxiousness that invariably drives people away. This doesn't make his loneliness any less real, which is illustrated at the end of the tune by a slow, sad finale. I grew up listening to this kind of music on my parents' radio so I really enjoyed bringing elements of my favourites from the Fifties to life in this song!\n<i>Cro:</i>\nIt's amusing once more to be drawing Cronus; he's practically a staple for me. That being said, I had a challenging but workable idea of how I wanted to present the piece. Seeing Cronus on a quest for love but failing would eventually lead to that path of sulking, and that is presented within his gray, stormy scheme (that, and the 50's barely had much in color still). With the fact he's outside of a dream bubble (a watery, lily pad dream bubble) where a red string of fate passes, it's almost like he's fishing for a pirze without really getting any bites. T oget even deeper into this harshness, the fact that it's a dream bubble can only leave for his hopes to be trapped in that; a dream. Something that could come so close, yet so far, and he continues trying to get a fish to catch his hook.",

It's kind of an uncharacteristically cool looking portrait of Horuss to match a track that has an understated strength and dtermination, creating a sense of tragedy since none of the Zahhaks seem to ever live up to the promise of their strength.",

Due to what we've seen in comic, I picture Kankri to have a strained relationship with the other trolls, leaving him feeling left out more often than not. This piece starts out bravado with a crunchy organ, representing Kankri's own bravado and righteous outlook, transitioning into a sad and lonely bit of chimes and violin. The piece ends with warm strings (they are his friends after all), leaving with a callback to the lonely chimes.\nI titled this piece SOlus Vates, which is probably horrible Latin as I've never taken a course, buti t's meant to mean Lonely Seer/Prophet, relating to the left out and lonely feeling Kankri feels around his companions as well as his role as the Seer of Blood.\n<i>Sam Garcia:</i>\nwhen i heard the song i just felt sorry for kankri, it represents pretty well how lonely kankri felt in his timeline, so in the drawing i decided to put kankri in a place where he would have spent most of his time during beforus, and i thought a library or some sort of study would fit well! and at the corner of the table some colorful flowers to represent his friends that are kinda with him. i had a lot of fun drawing this! i hope you like the drawing ^^",

It was harder than i expected, i did know what kind of vibe i would want to give it; hiphop/breakbeat with an oldschool vibe to it, something that would remind you of tony hawk pro skater. But i would make it very melodic with heavy 8bit-like influences to better suit her gamer girl character. Choosing a chord progression also was quite a challenge to me, it had to suit her character. After playing around and switching up orders i ended up with something that just felt right.\nThe first part represents hir first impression, the downtempo part is dedicated to her more serious 'libra side'. In the end it will all come together and really emphasise the radical personality she has created for herself.\n<i>oxfordroulette:</i>\nThe DJ scratches in the track reminded me of some kind of golden age of hip hop/Blade Runner fusion.

Latula allows herself to let go of her \"rad girl\" act around Porrim, which she uses as a defense channel for her insecurities regarding her lacking hte sense of smell. When Porrim and Latula interact, they are able to openly ponder about life and the mysteries of universal questions, such as the possibilities and the capabilities of fate, should fate truly exist. The heartbeat-like rhythm symbolizes their open heart-to-heart conversation, the chimes representing Latula's carefree spirit, and the mallets exprses Porrim's inquisitive thinking.\n<i>Josefin B.:</i>\nPorrim and Latula's interactions have always been one of m yfavourite parts of Homestuck as a whole. Their conversation, to me, seems like a break from the actual story and we get two adult women being friends and discussing spiritual, universal and personal matters. I wanted to capture that, but also their own personalities in the art. We have Latula, who happily leans over Porrim as a greeting, trusting her to be there. We have Porrim, calmly waiting for Latula whom she trusts will arive. Latula is not wearing her shades, because these two see things eye-to-eye.",

That song is about Porrim, and incorporates ideas of her radiance as a rainbow drinker, and so I had those images in my mind when I was putting this song together. However, for my own spin on the LMDLMG leitmotif, I wanted to give the track a broader meaning, so I decided to turn this into a song about the Green Sun, and how its light shines through the furthest ring and presides over the Beforan session (and many others). I used a similar set of sounds to those which I incorporated into [[Formant (Sprite Chorus Mix)]], the eponymous Formant synth common in both tracks always having given me the feeling of radiant light.\n<i>Circlejourney:</i>\nThe track is nominally about the Green Sun, but the inclusion of the main leitmotif in Porrim's principal track links the Sun to Porrim specifically. I found that an interesting relationship and decided to explore it in the track art. This track gives me a strong ethereal cosmic vibe; to match that, I drew Porrim basking in the glrious light of the Green Sun, which fills half the sky even though it lies beyond the universe, indicating its power and importance. Deep magenta seemed like the perfect colour to pair with the sun's green.",

I focused on the motif of the ring itself, and Aranea's life/death, giving her one dead eye and one living eye, split by the shadows. The ring itself is incorporated into her seven pupils, and the circular overlays.",

Thus Beforus is represented by the Pink Moon standing alone in the sky; the Beforan players contemplate it from a tree branch of one of the Pyrope's forest. Is this a night before the end? A dreambubble illusion? As the track art for the last song on disk 2, the ambiguity seemed fitting. One way or another, it's now nothing more than a bittersweet recollection of simpler times.",

In the end, though, it grew into something bigger, band became an integral and important section of the album, containing some of our most key tracks. With the same track count as Disc 1, it keeps the album nicely balanced lengthwise, and is characterised by tracks that are somehow different from the principal themes of that Disc and the more narrative soundtrack pieces of Disc 2. These include tracks that did not slot easily into the Disc 2 chronology, remixes, vocal tracks, and a few special pieces for the album finale.\n<i>magnoliajades:</i>\nThis was probably the first (or one of the first) art pieces made for the Beforus project, as it was also used as promotional art. I was honored to have the privilege of creating it, and kept it simplistic as I did not know what to expect out of the art that others would be putting toward the project later on. Also, I had no other way to quickly create digital art at the time other than with an iPad. I like to think I helped make everyone else's art look even greater! I also thought about karaoke parties while making this, but I think that's perfectly fine.",

Pink is a decidedly strange colour to associate with nighttime, but I do enjoy the imagery immensely. This track is meant to evoke the image of a mysterious pink night. It combines ethereal piano accents with a square lead riff that one might associate with Meenah Peixes, who lived on the moon for a period of time.\n<i>Yellowstockings:</i>\nThis piece exploers the visual effects of a pink moon's light on a Beforian seascape and a young Meenah as she contemplates abdication. The drama and scope of the track Fuchsia Moonrise lent itself to a turbulent seascape while the quieter aspects of the track inspired something more contemplative and calm.",

The end.\n<i>Vanessa Auqué:</i>\nFor the track art I wanted to focus more on Meulin being controlled, so I chose to show her as a cross between a puppet and doll, as a nod to all the mind controlling and chucklevoodoo stuff going on with Kurloz. She gets her mind broken into and toyed with like it's no big deal, by none other than her closest friend, for who knows how long, and then lights some catnip with him afterwards.

It didn't end up how I originally imagined, but I think it's frantic in just the right way, the repititions rae a bit unnerving in just the right way. Boss battle songs odn't usually fade out, but neither do entire universes and their heroes! This track is named after the Beforan session scratch construct, and is meant to convey the inner workings of our lovely Thief during the very last high-stakes moment of her life. The original plan was to include a sadder, slow portion; owever, when it came time to finalize, that just didn't feel right. This was something Meenah ahd been planning ever since the Horrorterrors spoke to her. Of course she has feelings, but she wasn't about to have a change of heart on this: not when it would save all of her friends. She's sweet (and terrifying) like that.\n<i>Txesare:</i>\nI tried to show Meenah in a situation where she is considering the repercussions, where she's certain this is the best option even though such a huge price has to be paid.",

At first, there was supposed to have drums in the song, but I found the sound to be more wide, threating and John Carpenter-esque. In the middle part, I quoted Flare by Plazmataz because why not. I made all the sounds with NI Massive. // When I heard about the project, I wanted to do a cool Cronus track... except that he's not really cool. So I made him an 80's cop. I tried to do something like John Carpenter: epic, dangerous and a lot of arpeggios.\n<i>rockytoad:</i>\nI read that it was supposed to be 80's cop Cronus and played around for a little bit with that. The theme sounds dark and emotional, which rpompted me to, humorously, think about that meme where a person is on a stool with a microphone and has faded versions of their face around. Obviously I didn't do that here, but the more I thought about it seriously, the mroe I thought it'd fit.",

I focused on the mood of the song (and how the sound of the vocals made me feel) more so than the lyrics, and tried to capture those moods in this picture.

        "commentary": "<i>Blackhole:</i>\nThis one was based on a somewhat crackpot idea of mine that had been floating around in my head for a while. Uptown Funk is undoubtedly one of the best records of this decade so far, and, what with the concept of the Homestuck song parody having a fairly rich canon at this point, I thought it was a shame that it had yet to get the same treatment. I thought a fairly tongue-in-cheek \"East Beforan Funk\" re-arrangement and re-lyricised cover of the track would be a fun thing to slot in at the end of the album. Several times I thought that I might not finish it in order to make the cut, especially seeing as arranging the entire track with new instrumentation in FL was incredibly painstaking, but I got there in the end!\nThe whole vocal portion of the track is somewhat of an homage to a failed project that I was working on with the pseudonymous \"The D\" some years ago, \"Scourge Siblings\", to record some of the lyrical accompaniments that I'd written for various Homestuck tracks over the years. None of that ever really came to full fruition despite our best efforts at the time, but I think this is probably the best thing that could have come out of that failed project! I hope it as fun to listen to as it was to make.\n<i>memento vivere:</i>\nI figured that a parody of a real song deserved parody album artwork to match, so of course I ended up Funkifying Rifoh and Damara and mimicking the actual Uptown Funk album artwork. Considering the state that we saw Damara and Rufioh in Openbound, it was kinda nice to be able to draw them from a time when they were having lighthearted fun together!",

It was insanely challenging, least of all trying to find some way to fit in all of the principal tracks. I've tried my best to include something that sort of sounds close to each of the tracks while telling a story, but I apologise if it's not exactly what or as much as you expect.\nThe King Awakens. Kankri's Rally. Horuss and Rufioh's Attempt. Meulin and Kurloz's Carnival. Damara, Centre Stage. Retaliation and Aranea's Failure. Porrim's Glow. Cronus's Final Stand. Mituna and Latula's Efforts. Aranea's Return. Meenah's Finale.\nI could spend a while talking about this so I'll just note a few things: Kurloz mimics RDA like Gamzee did. Aranea attempts to make a big show against the king around 4.33, but fails (Porrim steps up to help after this). The Thirteenth Hour appears at the end of the Mituna/Latula section as well. It's something \"ve always wanted to reference in a track and seemed appropriate for thsi song that was literally finished in the last hours of the project. I hope you've enjoyed this album as much as I enjoyed spending several long nights toiling over this piece.\n<i>HermesNitram:</i>\nThe fight with the Black King is surely one of the most exciting parts of the game, and I tried to show the spirit of the fight that each Beforus troll would have. The order of trolls on the picture follows the track, and each one has been assigned the most possible fitting weapon that would help them fight the Black King. In order of appearance: Kankri (Social Justice speech), Horuss (untamed strength of bare fists), Rufioh (spear and shield), Kurlzo (chucklevoodoos and needle with thread), Meulin (written fanfiction), Damara (wands), Porrim (glow and the Gigli chainsaw), Cronus (Ahab's Crosshairs), Mituna & Latula (Troll Playstation), Aranea (dice and Mindfang's sword), and Meenah (2x3dent). The visualization of Black King is left to the imagination of the audience.",

I wrote the song to be dramatic because the Scratch, for them, signifies the end of their roles as players in their session.\n<i>Rangzhe:</i>\nI wanted to show the initiation, the process, and the result of the Beforus trolls' scratch. Damara, happily volunteering and having the power in the first place, initiated the cardinal movement, and Meenah blowing up everybody so that they would continue to exist as ghosts, and the result, their alternate selves born in a whole new world and society.

        "commentary": "<i>Grace Medley:</i>\nMoons of Theseus is an album idea we had lying around from before UnofficialMSPAFans' recent year of 0 content, and it's a project a lot of us had been looking forward to for a long time. Fitting, too, that it's named for the paradox in which every piece of an object is replaced gradually until it has nothing physically in common with its original state. The idea for Home we had back then is nothing like what you hear now. SplitSuns and I didn't know what we wanted back then, beyond \"Oh hey, you want to make a tribute to Forever? Me too!\" It's safe to say that little to none of that initial desire to reimagine Mobius Trip's overture has bled through into the finished product, but it's safer still to say that this song wouldn't be possible if it had been approached any other way. That's not the only thing that's changed in the meantime, either: since we initially promised to collaborate on this, we've both improved as composers and producers, and our styles have evolved, our influences are different, and the zeitgeist of what it means to be a Homestuck fan, particularly a Homestuck music fan, is practically unrecognisable.\nFor me, making Home was one hell of an experience. I taught myself a lot of new techniques while co-writing and co-producing it, and I'm proud of it in a way I've never been proud of anything else before. Much like the song itself, I'm no longer the same weedy, slightly annoying kid who made a bunch of tracks on [[album:weird-puzzle-tunes]]. That kid couldn't dream of making something like this. Strictly speaking, I couldn't either. This was a team effort with one of the best friends I've made through UnofficialMSPAFans. So a huge thank you to SplitSuns for pushing this song to its maximum potential is in order, as is another to our two fantastic vocalists, Ucklin and WHATISLOSTINTHEMINES. I also want to thank all of the friends I've made through Homestuck music, and by extension, the comic itself. I don't think I'd still be making stuff with this project without your love, kindness, and good humour.\nMaybe this is narcissistic (or at the very least, laughably ambitious) for me to say, but I hope that when you listen to Home, you hear some echo of the past or other that resonates with you. I also hope that it feels like something you've never heard before. Much like the titular ship of Theseus, the form has been made anew, but the essence is the same as it always was.\n<i>SplitSuns:</i>\nI honestly can't recall exactly when the first time Grace and I discussed our love for Forever was, or when that love transformed into making a full-blown tribute, but over the many, MANY months, our pact to realize our emotions in song finally came to fruition. This is the first time I've done such a large-scale collaboration, and it's safe to say that it exceeded all my expectations. Neither of us thought that a track tributing a three minute opener would turn into a multi-part 10:25 epic, but life tends to have ways of surprising you. It wasn't easy balancing the track's complexities, which is why I was beyond grateful to have Grace help out with organizing things. This song would not be what it is without her; it wouldn't even exist at all, really! Her skills cannot be overstated.\nThe first components of the song were completed by Grace. She wrote and composed the lyrics for the vocal section, and produced the majority of the guitar breakdown/climax towards the end of the track. From there we planned a road map of the song's progression to link together what had been completed: an ambient intro similar to Forever, a transition to lead into the vocal section, the vocal section, another transition to lead to the climax, the climax, and then an ending. I produced the majority of the intro and first transition, with Grace providing additional production and WHATISLOSTINTHEMINES playing live guitar! My goal was to create a composition with the same sense of scale and drama as Forever while having a unique mood, playful and hopeful all at once. I produced the vocal section to match Grace's songwriting, with additional production from Grace; MINES' lo-fi strains contrasted with Ucklin's ethereal melodies very nicely, right on top of a groove I never anticipated coming out of the project. The second transition was done entirely by Grace, bridging the gap between the dance that came before and the cinematic breakdown coming after. Finally, I provided additional production on the climax and created the ending. We wanted something like, in Grace's words, \"the digital-age counterpart to the end of Have a Cigar.\" The result was a little bit more violent than that, but it provides a thrilling conclusion to the experience all the same, jettisoning off into the Incipisphere.\nThe varied parts of Home take you by the hand and guide you on a journey throughout time and space. It is my belief that by listening, you're taking the same journey Grace, myself, and all the other creatives involved in this album took in the process of making the project a reality. It's been a long and winding road, but I wouldn't have had it any other way. Thank you.",

That was the penultimate song on that album, and this is the second on this album. So in a way, they're like weird bookends. More to the point though, this song ended up as an unintentional but fortuitous continuation to the \"voyage\" brought up in Home, both physical and metaphysical. In literal terms the lyrics are about the crossing of humans along the Bering Strait, but another interpretation is that they're a reflection of a process all humans go through: the pursuit of a purpose, the satisfaction of completing a goal, and the perennial urge to find new things to do, new things to learn, to experience, to travel. It's a fundamental feeling, true from the dawn of you, to your last sail on the pumpkin tide.\n<i>Tipsy:</i>\nNaturally when everyone else is going for wild, creative concepts, I fall back on making it Homestuck... when I heard Cait's song it made me think of the Battlefield, and when I read the lyrics, I thought, what better thing to depict than the moment Mobius Trip and Hadron Kaleido look into the clouds for the first time and witness the secrets of the universe?",

A departure from MTAHK's mellow sound, Unchained ended up being rather frantic and abrasive, resembling something akin to an explosive release of all the suppressed emotions that have been bottling up inside one's heart for way too long - destruction of emotional shackles, in other words. As for Skyplayer's artwork, I think it compensates for what the song might be lacking in terms of depth. Vivid 3-dimensional imagery paired with vibrant colours definitely makes it stand out from other illustrations.\n<i>Skyplayer:</i>\nChain of Prospit has always been one of my all-time favorite Homestuck songs. Even just the title of Unchained immediately gave me visions of the Prospit Moon's broken connection to Prospit, but unlike [S] Descend, where the event is catastrophic, I wanted to depict the moon coming loose as a moment of freedom.",

I started the song months ago, but wasn't able to quite capture the themes that I intended, so I decided to go back to the drawing board to create what is now the chorus. I decided it was worthwhile to find a way t ocombine the two ideas because I didn't want to think of more, and the verse did capture a mood that I didn't want to get rid of. I think the resulting transitions are potentially jarring, but I feel okay with the atmosphere that creates. I wanted to make a true MTaHK koan, so I won't tell you what the song is about eaxctly.

I made it back in July of 2018 for the Cool and New Music Team's \"Volume 11\" project, a plan to make a fan-made meme-filled image of a fake Volume 11 from the Homestuck Music Team's Bandcamp page a reality. All the songs, including a 12-hour \"extended\" version of Penumbra Phantasm, a rock opera made out of Michael Guy Bowman memes, and a sequel to the Baby is You, were painstakingly produced based on the ideas (and jokes) the track names suggested. Each song's length was the same as it was in the original image, and photoshopped reviews were even added on the album's page using dummy accounts!\nFor my song (originally called \"The Return of Mobius Trip and Hadron Kaleido\") the team was planning on playing it straight and producing a medley of songs from MTaHK. I went with their idea and made a mega-mix of every song on the album, with the caveat being it had to be 6:12 long exactly! I first planned out the structure of the song on a single piano track to make sure it fit the time limit, then went back in and fleshed out all the instrumentation. I wanted it to be reminiscent of Bowman's work, with his classic guitar flourishes, but put my own spin on it all the same. The whole project kind of crystallized over the course of a single week I spent stuck to my computer 24/7, continually tweaking it to make sure the track flowed despite its disparate parts. If you're interested to find out more about its production process check out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqpcqEpMndA\">this video</a>.\nAll in all, it's a fast-paced schizophrenic redux of the highlights of MTaHK (which is to say, the whole album) that even now I'm still proud of. I'm happy to have the opportunity to put it on this amazing album!",

This is an update to the version of Pumpkin Tide that I did on my iPad when I was in the hospital, recovering from my bone marrow transplant. I took some comfort in the way that the lyrics seemed to fit my experience leaving school for my treatment and being thrust into an unwanted \"adventure.\" I wanted to keep this version pretty simple, so it's almost entirely just multitracked recordings of my acoustic instruments. I did add a touch of phased and flanged reverb because I wanted it to feel like a live performance on another world.\n<i>piskomil:</i>\nA remake of my old piece from 2013. I gave it a proper background that compliments the song. Peaceful but a bit broken up and in the process of healing.",

        "commentary": "<i>Veritas Unae:</i>\nBack in May 2012, Liza posted some lyrics to their Tumblr. I know because I went back and looked up the original post. May 21, 2012. And at the time, I knew I wanted to make something inspired by and using those lyrics. So I started working on a song... but of course, things got busy for me.\nLet's fast forward seven years, shall we?\nThe final version of Vilet and Gold that you're listening to hopefully does the Mobius Trip and Hadron Kaleido album justice, and gives life to Liza's original lyrics. Each track of MTaHK is referenced here, as well as Sburban Jungle and Derse Dreamers for good measure. The end of the song is a dramatic retelling of Dawn of Man, with lyrics referencing more recent events in Homestuck. It's been ten years since Homestuck first started and I knew I always wanted to have something big to finish off this song. (I just didn't know at the time it would be some sweet Beta Version bass.)\nI'd like to thank Imbrog for helping me out way back in 2012 with the chord progressions at the start of the song, and to Ucklin for lending her voice to Hadron's part. She's really brought Bowman's character to life and I'm deeply thankful. Also thanks to Mines for recording some live guitar for this piece, and of course thanks to Liza for their beautiful original lyrics.\nWhich vantage is your story told from? Are you a Dersite carapacian, fighting a war you never wanted to have? Do you dream like a Prospit Carapacian of the futility of your existence, in a battle you cannot win?\nViolet and gold.\n<i>Jas:</i>\nMuch like the differences between Prospit and Derse we used two clashing mediums to show how they can work in tandem even better than apart. This is a duet in more ways than one!",

Solitude! Filth! Ugliness! Ashcans and unobtainable dollars! Children screaming under the stairways! Boys sobbing in armies! Old men weeping in the parks!<br>Moloch! Moloch! Nightmare of Moloch! Moloch the loveless! Mental Moloch! Moloch the heavy judger of men!<br>Moloch the incomprehensible prison! Moloch the crossbone soulless jailhouse and Congress of sorrows! Moloch whose buildings are judgment! Moloch the vast stone of war! Moloch the stunned governments!<br>Moloch whose mind is pure machinery! Moloch whose blood is running money! Moloch whose fingers are ten armies! Moloch whose breast is a cannibal dynamo! Moloch whose ear is a smoking tomb!<br>Moloch whose eyes are a thousand blind windows! Moloch whose skyscrapers stand in the long streets like endless Jehovahs! Moloch whose factories dream and croak in the fog! Moloch whose smoke-stacks and antennae crown the cities!<br>Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!<br>Moloch in whom I sit lonely! Moloch in whom I dream Angels! Crazy in Moloch! Cocksucker in Moloch! Lacklove and manless in Moloch!<br>Moloch who entered my soul early! Moloch in whom I am a consciousness without a body! Moloch who frightened me out of my natural ecstasy! Moloch whom I abandon! Wake up in Moloch! Light streaming out of the sky!<br>Moloch! Moloch! Robot apartments! invisible suburbs! skeleton treasuries! blind capitals! demonic industries! spectral nations! invincible madhouses! granite cocks! monstrous bombs!<br>They broke their backs lifting Moloch to Heaven! Pavements, trees, radios, tons! lifting the city to Heaven which exists and is everywhere about us!<br>Visions! omens! hallucinations! miracles! ecstasies! gone down the American river!<br>Dreams! adorations! illuminations! religions! the whole boatload of sensitive bullshit!<br>Breakthroughs! over the river! flips and crucifixions! gone down the flood! Highs! Epiphanies! Despairs! Ten years’ animal screams and suicides! Minds! New loves! Mad generation! down on the rocks of Time!<br>Real holy laughter in the river! They saw it all! the wild eyes! the holy yells! They bade farewell! They jumped off the roof! to solitude! waving! carrying flowers! Down to the river! into the street!",

Better it be yours than mine, an empty sinking pit of hunger tunnelling down to the centre of the earth, chewing red flesh and spitting black seeds.\n the rain pulls down curtains around you, flooding subway stations and cascading down the glass sheet faces of skyscrapers. I see the future in refracted light, and it is the rainbow in a puddle of oil. The scattered remnants of the way we used to live adorn our walls, sit abandoned in drawers, in brief moments of recollection, at the edge of conversations, foam flecks on a black table, lights adorning street-sides, between blank walls of concrete reaching up into the sky.",

The second was to make it feel like the in-betweens of the holiday experience: after the unwrapping of presents or whichiver main celebration applies, in the midst of the gathering, before everyone's said their goodbyes and while the spirit of holiday cheer still remains. A theme you could have a cup of hot chocolate to while engaging a seldom-seen relative in lighthearted conversation.\nWhether I succeeded in these things is up to you.

The melody always struck me from the beginning as rather festive-feeling, even if it didn't use the standard musical tropes for Christmas music, so I took this idea and set out to make the most Christmassy electronic music I could make.\nThe lyrics also only rather obliquely reference Homestuck; it's never mentioned by name, I chose the most mild-sounding aspects of the story to directly reference, and not once is conksuck or shit lets be santa dropped.

    "commentary": "<i>Erik Scheele:</i>\n<center><small>okay first things first</small><br>I<br>MADE THIS<br><big>FOR YOU</big></center>\nYes you. The one sitting at their computer or phone or other gadget, you the one who's doing their hair or putting on flair like you just don't care, you the one sitting at a desk or laying in a bed or even hiding from the cops, I don't really care, this was made for you. It's been worked on over a long period of time (technically almost two years!), it's been delayed and pushed back, it was actually not even going to come out for a while, but here it is. And I'm incredibly thankful that you, whoever you are and whatever your interest, are spending the time to listen to this music.\nSo what is this, then? Well, back when the Homestuck music team was all jumping on the concept of \"solo albums\", I said to myself, hum, why not do one? The original concept was incredibly vague, because I'm not a very imaginative person most of the time, an album for John Egbert that used piano in most every track to some degree. And after a few tracks were made, a more specific idea began to emerge, that of an album sequentially examined moments in his journey through SBURB, music for key points or just for scenes. I even graphed the entire (known) timeline out on a giant piece of paper and plotted it all out. It's turned out to be far more ambitious and broad of a goal than I'd originally planned for, especially with how \"key events known\" slowly eclipsed \"key events to unfold\" over time, but I feel confident enough about how this album has turned out that I'm not too worried. And if anything, that means more music has come to you.\nNow, before I start rambling at length about the music in here, I've got to toss out a few \"thank you\"s to people.\nFirst, to all the artists that helped out with the track art. The stuff that they've all given me is just incredible, and if you ever ask me what my favorite part of this album is I would defiitely say \"the art\". I may be biased. There's full versions of all the album art with the album itself, and I'd highly encourage you to give it a look-over and see what else these talented people have put out.\nSecond, to the other people in the music team, who've helped me go from \"some guy who uses famitracker and an awful microphone\" to \"somewhat of an okay digital musician\". I'm thankful for every bit of critiquing I've gotten, too, even if I can be really stubborn about it. And all the bros I know in there, if I could meet everyone in person there would be endless fistbumps. You guys rock.\nThird, to all the friends and people I've met over the years, through Homestuck and otherwise, that've been great to hang out with and chill with and just talk about stupid random things with.\nFourth, to my family for always being around, and for....well, being family. Keeping me alive and healthy and stuff and keeping me from completely failing in this \"life\" thing.\nAnd lastly to Andrew Hussie for creating Homestuck, making the really crazy decision to bring me onto the team in the first place, and for giving me the opportunity to both make an album and just make music for him in the first place. I don't know how little I would've composed if I didn't have Homestuck pushing along, both giving me a reason to write and things to write about.\nAlright! Now that all that before-album talk is done with, it's time to get into the album proper. I hope you, out there, enjoy this album, and I'll see you on the flipside.\n<i>Signed, Erik \"Jit\" Scheele</i>",

So I wanted to take time with this piece, and create a sort of smooth, shifting landscape, illustrating the sun rising over John's neighborhood before he wakes up. This was mainly achieved by intersparsing little melodic hits on instruments with each other, building up and fading out in turn. The opening from a rather old tune of mine, \"Light\" from Volume 5, also makes an appearance in here to further the overall effect.\nI imagine, if this piece were performed live, it would do best with all the instrumentalists scattered to some degree. And I usually hate that gimmick, but it could work well in this context.",

        "commentary": "<i>Eric Scheele:</i>\nNow to completely break away from the previous track, we move into a peppy, small ensemble piece. This one just started out because I wanted a tight ensemble to play something together, something sort of bouncy and light. Before that, I'd been making a lot of pieces that felt unnecessarily large, sticking in instruments for just one little section and not using them the rest of the time, so something lighter with more emphasis on individual parts seemed like a great idea. I had no idea what to call it, though, and it didn't really seem to have much context in terms of the album either, until I was looking through the 2010 calendar that the art team made, and came across the October artwork. Immediately it was like, that was it, the piece both fit the \"kids and fun\" aesthetic that lasted a while in the beginning, and the artwork fit too, so it achieved purpose and title both at the same time.\nInstrumentally it fit too, it had piano and bass and bitcrushed drums that sounded somewhat like beatboxing, which were three out of the four instruments the original kids used. There's definitely a discrepancy with using synth vs. violin, though. Before anyone asks, I definitely spent time trying to fandangle string patches into it, but it just didn't work. So you can imagine Rose playing an electric violin, that's what I do. (I don't know if electric violins can function like that string players please don't strangle me thank you)",

Everything's dark, except for the stars above, but as we found out, they were really fireflies trapped in the clouds. This was one of the concepts I latched onto rather hard with this piece, the mass of sparkling and blinking above John as he traipsed about. I've been lucky enough to live in a more rural area for most of my life, and being able to watch the stars was always great, so I could only ever imagine what LOWAS's clouds looked like.\nAnyway. I kept the sparkling mainly to the piano, higher register work with some delay making a nice twinkling effect. I'd also just gotten some wonderful \"piano in an attic for 80 years\" samples, which came with a large variety of inner-piano works, like tapping or heavy strokes of the strings, and I sprinkled those rather liberally in places to try and get the effect of thunder. (After all, what sort of lightning storms could a firefly cloud have, anyway?)\nAnd of course, there's one or two Doctor quotes in there just because.",

At the time of writing this, that track still hasn't been released, but that didn't stop me from making a cover of it. And then re-making that cover, since the first one was kind of crap.\nNot really a whole lot of deep thought or anything with this, I just thought the melody sounded cool and it could work for a sort of high-energy swooping-around sort of thing. And then later, I associated it with John's jetpack flight after he gets warned off from dying to his planet's Denizen, so that's what it became.\nOn a completely random note this piece always makes me want to go out running, and I have done so to this piece a few times. If I could do flips and parkour and stuff I'd totally be doing that too cause it works really well. Maybe gunfights too. Alright let's move on to the next piece.",

And a little later, I was fortunate enough to get a good recording of it before heading home for the summer.\nThe piece itself is meant to go along with John discovering Jade's dead dreamself, after waking up on Skaia for the first time. I know a lot of people associate [[Sarabande]], from Volume 5, with that event, or at least with John reading Jade's letter, but I couldn't help but want to at least touch on it while going through his timeline. Originally I'd stuck this before John even entered the Medium, but that didn't really have any moment tacked on with it, and it made much more sense here.",

Basically all you need to know is that there's a car that can fly and it's flying. Like pchooo flying. It's awesome.\nFor the piece, I went with this old idea I had a few years back in college, a 13/8 double-piano piece. Seeing as I'm not two piano players, though, I wanted to orchestrate it out a bit, so I put some brighter instruments to double the melody, over top of the original riff, and beefed it up with some light strings and drums. A few other instruments come in later as the piece developed, but like [[October]], I tried to keep it all to a small group and not let the orchestration explode.",

It might just be because the Tomb Raider series was a favorite while growing up, but I've always loved old, unexplored ruins, arcane or mystical elements hinted at with wall carvings or murals, that sort of thing. And Skaia, being the center of a sort of central planet to everything in Sburb, could be chock-full of old buildings and mystical secrets to explore.\nSo, to try and accompany the general air of mystery and exploration that would have gone with a long journey into the center of Skaia, I took an old idea in Locrian mode. If you're a music person, Locrian is when you take a major scale, but start it on the last note. It's a rather off-kilter scale, and it can't ever really resolve to the tonic chord like most other scales can, which made it rather suited to a piece about the sort of strange secrets and landscapes that could be hidden in the center of Skaia.",

At any rate, when John was stabbed and \"died\" (god tier characters can only truly die from a Just or Heroic death), he stayed dead for a few minutes. And for those few minutes, I imagined that he came to a sort of Game Over screen, or, if you were playing a video game of Homestuck, you would come to a Game Over screen. From there, you could either continue or give up, which is a pretty staple part of game over screens, I think.\nAt any rate, the music I went for was to just go along with that, a peaceful song for his demise before he came back. It feels kind of morbid, but since the concept of death has kind of gone out the window and back again in Homestuck, it's hardly as morbid as it could be.",

I've held it back from getting released just so it could go on this record, so I'm glad it could finally go out.\nThis is also the only piece on the album that doesn't have a specific event to go along with it. Instead, I went for where it appeared in the comic when placing it, and see it as more of a small interlude. The intermission between Act 1 and Act 2 of a musical, if you will. The art is meant to go along with this as well, a sort of non-canon get-together of the first set of trolls and kids we know, and I can imagine them playing this record while they chill.",

At the time, the scratched copy of Sburb was just starting to show some real-world effects by making the \"game\" (aka our viewing experience as an audience) glitch up. So, I set about making some heavier action music for it, incorporating heavy use of weird, messed-up glitching sounds and a few heavy-handed uses of numerical motifs. I also brought in Ruins, one of the first piano pieces I ever recorded, the latter section of Wakl-Stab-Walk, and Crystalanthemums.\nOverall, in my opinion at least, the piece turned out a little strange, a little awkward, and not really nice, but really that works just fine for me. Everything was really going for the characters at the time, after all. People were getting hunted down, friends were turning on each other, nobody in the fandom really knew who was going to be next. Was this person? Or this person? Were you next? It all led to a heavy air of unease that sort of manifested itself in the odd piano riff and distorted drums that were used, and all the heavy glitching that led us up to...",

It also served as the inspiration for a project that my third-year piano studio did.\nIn the comic, this event was basically a way to reset the universe, everything inside it, and recreate it in a different way, one that would make the game winnable. So, in my head, a mass de-compilation of everything, like a massive maelstrom building as bits of data are pulled apart. A black hole, in other words, but arcing out in waves of energy ilke lightning. Mother Nature ain't got crap on this beast.\nThe piece started out as extreme laziness on my aprt, just idle playing around with various distortion on synths and samples, until the school project came up and wanted results fast. So I threw some things together until they formed the opening, and took a very lax approach to the piano part, a sort of \"here's a riff, now play around with it, there's your part\" with a drum loop over top. Thankfully my laziness didn't extend to the whole thing, and it all got more polished up and developed over time. It still keeps the \"improvised piano part based off one riff\" idea, though.",

And, in some games I've played, there's a sort of resting area before the final boss, or a small break to prepare yourself before the last battle. This is what spawned Respit, the idea of a light and airy, calming piece. I was also pretty reminded of Kingdom Heart's usage of the \"resting area\" trope, which was a small chamber with several large crystals around. So, I went with the idea of a large, reflective area, someplace in the dream bubbles perhaps, where the heroes could rest and reflect.\nThis is another one of those tracks, too, that tried to predict a future event but was overtaken as time went on. The concept of the dream bubbles and the long voyage John took fit my original idea well enough, though, so that's what the piece molded itself into being.",

It pulls from Showtime, the original strife music, and also (ironically enough) from an idea I had when I was around 11 and wanted to make something spooky for Halloween. Let me tell you, it worked way better in this context than my original plan.\nSo seeing as this is the final boss fight, there wasn't really any reason to hold back while adding in instruments and layers. To this day, it's definitely the largest piece I've made in instrumentation, and also the first to make me render everything out into separate files because my computer just couldn't handle it. Suffice to say, it's a pretty large piece, for a pretty large fight. There's a rather intentional and large nod to the aesthetic in [[Rex Duodecim Angelus]] by Malcolm Brown as well, since his piece was about the trolls' final fight with the Black King at the end of their session.\nAnd at the end, there's a little victory music to pass through and segue into the last piece...",

First thing I'd ever recorded, too, and I want to say it was done a few months after Homestuck had started. In my head, it fit in as a possible refrain for one of the characters, and the idea always stuck in my head that it could also work as a piece for the very ending for Homestuck, a sort of \"all is well\" refrain. After two years, I was finally able to make something like what I was thinking and put it in the right context.\nLike the [[Homestuck Anthem]], I went with using the four kids' instruments: piano, strings, drums/percussion, and bass, and stuck mainly with those. I also got some help by Mr. Lake of Awesome Beats Inc. who was way better at beats than I am, and he made it way better too. Big props to him.\nWith the new universe and many new characters being explored, this piece might not work for \"the end of Homestuck\" anymore, but if anything, I see it as a sort of moving forward. John's journey on that one day, when he turned 13, matured both him and his friends. Like many others, he took the hero's journey, and grew as a result of it, and so this piece could very well fit him leaving his universe and going on to the next, bringing his experiences and knowledge with him, just as well as it could fit him moving past Sburb to whatever adventures lie ahead.",

Anyway, between a chiptune variant I started and Trollcops, it's had a bit of a journey, but when it turned out alright on piano too, I didn't see any reason not to record a few takes.\nLet me just put this out here, I'm not a jazz pianist at all, nor is this really jazz. Not very complicated jazz, at any rate. I know there's way better jazz playing out there, and probably quite a few pianists that'll be wondering why some pianist douchebag thinks he can play jazz, well rest assured, I'm not claiming I'm amazing at all.\nOf course, not being able to play something magnificently and to the best form of the genre didn't really stop me from playing around with this piece.

Project management by Ucklin with help from additional Unofficial MSPA Fans managers.\nFeedback for revisions was given by all the artists in the UMSPAF discord, but I want to recognize Tipsy for being consistently present and offering constructive suggestions for nearly every piece!\nThough Makin stepped down after the planning stages of the project, I also want to thank him for the concept and his work sorting initial artist applications to make sure that everyone was assigned to a track that they wanted.\nSome final thoughts: This project went unbelieveably smoothly, completed in just one month. The majority of artists were invited on May 1st, and art was completed by the 31st. I'm glad we get a chance to appreciate the artists on our team: So many of these people could be spending their time making money with their art, and they're helping us enrich and expand on the Homestuck soundtrack instead!

The best to represent the song in my opinion was Rosebot: in the song the singer is repeating \"you just made a monster,\" acknowledging that they themselves are no longer a person and informing their initiator of what they had done. While designing the drawing I decided that rosebot had to be the center of attention of the piece so I focused on her color pallet and her aspect, light, was made to be just as robotic as she is, with orange metal linings as an example of ult dirks influence on her. The purple background is taken by her lunar sway, also, it was a good color to accompany the yellow in the piece. The rest are random metal plates with lining in between each plate forming a sort of tunnel with the only light being Rosebot and a clock of the moon and the sun surrounding her, each with their own meaning. In the end I love how the final piece came to be, I feel that it represents the song very well, and I had fun sharing with the organizers and the other artists. To be the first time working in this manner in a community was nice and I hope in the future to have similar opportunities like this.

Calliope the focus of this drawing. Eventually, I decided that Jade possessed by Alt. Calliope was the best fit, because the upbeat mood of the song fits Jade's personality, and the name was also very fitting for both characters since their aspect is space. I interpreted the \"Cosmic Carousel\" as the black hole turning endlessly in space while Alt. Calliope acts as the conductor as she watches over the various timelines. After my first sketch, I had Jade wield Calliope's wand, and I also gave her a happier expression to fit the overall mood of the song.\n<img src=\"media/misc/cosmic-carousel-wip1.jpg\" width=\"437\" height=\"481\">\n<img src=\"media/misc/cosmic-carousel-wip2.jpg\" width=\"460\" height=\"464\">\n<img src=\"media/misc/cosmic-carousel-wip3.jpg\" width=\"482\" height=\"482\">",

But turns out that they indeed Were Back, and I'm really looking forward to what they have in store. Dirk, the ==> command, and the Theseus seemed like the perfect trinity to represent a(n) (un)likely continuation to an already colossal story. The sky full of faint memories of the baffling/fascinating (Meat) Epilogues, Dirk as the constellation marking him as one of this universe's gods, the one who put that story into motion. There's another simpler track art I made that I also enjoy, but in my mind the piano and the stars go together much better, the one with Dirk and the huge ==> command feels like it'd accompany some electronic song instead.

Between a bunch of depressive episodes and just outstanding amounts of imposter syndrome, I had a lot of anxiety that I wouldn't even be able to make a track that was in the ballpark of \"good\", let alone at all worthy of being on the first official album of Homestuck^2. And for a while there, I wasn't really making things I was at all enjoying or proud of. I was worried of making something that wasn't \"homestuck\" enough, or wasn't something people were really expecting. But the support of the amazing Homestuck music team helped contribute to a track I can firmly say I'm proud of, and even being included on this album means the world to me.\nSo I really, really do hope you guys enjoy this <3\n<i>Gastlu:</i>\nOriginally I had drawn events throughout the timelines, though in my opinion, it looked a bit too much to focus on, so I scrapped that version, and, unfortunately I did not save that version, oops. Either way, I hope my abstract-y space-y art did the job, made a blackhole to represent, well, the blackhole which Alt. Callie turned into, added some green and orange effects for the narrative command battle going, though there's already a track for that, so it is minor, in the background, the real focus are the timelines, meat drips with death, candy is sweet and bright, though they both have some masks for what's really going on, we cannot see though, the reality is split and we're in SPACE.\n<img src=\"media/misc/split-reality-wip.jpg\" width=\"664\" height=\"664\">",

So I did my best to convey all of that. The track uses many synth sounds, or at least *some* synth sounds, and to me that was enough to justify going for the 80's neon aesthetic. I used mainly triadic palette where each colour corresponded to one of the characters: orange for Dirk, violet for Rose, teal/turquoise for Terezi. The theme of \"three\" is also reinforced by the triangle shape, which I referenced in composition as well as by slapping a big fat triangle in the middle of the picture. It works as a visual portal and also represents the letter Delta (as in Deltritus, the name of the new planet). The idea of actual assembling of the game is referenced through the Venn diagram glyph inside the portal and by those sick grid mountains in the background that I totally didn't trace from some random stock image. There's some more symbolism stuffed in the picture but this commentary is already too long and I'd like to leave some things open to interpretation. Doing track art has been a long dream of mine, and I'm extremely glad and thankful I've been given this chance to participate in this project!\n<img src=\"media/misc/assembly-wip1.jpg\" width=\"329\" height=\"469\">\n<img src=\"media/misc/assembly-wip2.jpg\" width=\"494\" height=\"467\">\n<img src=\"media/misc/assembly-wip3.jpg\" width=\"490\" height=\"471\">",

Especially Dirk, Terezi and Rose leaving earth C, Dirk thinking there is nothing left to do on Earth C and seeing leaving as the only way to move forward, Terezi leaving after John's death (mentions of air and wind), and Rose not wanting to hurt Kanaya by leaving but having no other choice.

It's cool to see Homestuck^2 parallel some stuff from OG Homestuck, and it's especially cool with the heartfelt or hopeful moments; paralleling is largely where my art inspo came from. Seeing John and BGD aiding Jake again is great, especially since that was near the end of OG Homestuck, while Homestuck^2 is beginning with that (which seems to be the case with other stuff, too, like Jade being possessed). Furthermore, it's that teamwork/hopeful stuff (like John and BGD aiding Jake, but also Dave comforting Kanaya, etc.) in Homestuck^2 that really feels like the idea of \"beginnings in endings\" to me, whether it parallels OG Homestuck or not. All of the characters are struggling right now, and it's nice to think that they might be able to help each other out and make something together out of all that struggling.\n<img src=\"media/misc/after-the-sun-wip1.jpg\" width=\"340\" height=\"331\">\n<img src=\"media/misc/after-the-sun-wip2.jpg\" width=\"330\" height=\"310\">\n<img src=\"media/misc/after-the-sun-wip3.jpg\" width=\"313\" height=\"273\">\n<img src=\"media/misc/after-the-sun-wip4.jpg\" width=\"331\" height=\"328\">\n<img src=\"media/misc/after-the-sun-wip5.jpg\" width=\"275\" height=\"303\">",

I might transcribe this for my music project.</blockquote>\nThis might make it a bit easier — I made a notated blueprint before I started producing it (notated on two piano grand staves, because that's easy for me to parse, but it's certainly not a playable two-piano score). It's not 100% accurate to how it wound up (and I'm not going to fix it, because I don't have any use for an accurate \"score\"), but if you take this as a slightly-flawed transcription you can probably get the rest relatively easily. <a href=\"media/misc/narrative-command-blueprint.pdf\">(link!)</a>\n<blockquote>I don’t want to do this beautiful track a disservice by comparing it to music that’s already been made, because it’s one of the most original and creative songs ive ever heard, but it also does kind of sound like all the songs on [[album:Cherubim]] had a brawl and kicked the shit out of each other</blockquote>\nIt intentionally sounds tangentially like a bit of OG Homestuck music (without quoting anything). Calliope's music is a little like some of One Year Older (like [[Firefly Cloud]]) and [[Voidlight]] (from HS Vol. 10). At the beginning of Homestuck^2, Dirk said \"Finally, this story is back on the rails. Maybe we can get back to what things were like in the good old days,\" so his music sounds more stereotypically Homestuck, with the quasi-chiptune style that's in a lot of classic Homestuck music.\n<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>have fun trying to transcribe dirk's 13/8 section lmao</blockquote><i>but consider: 13/4</i></blockquote>but consider: 13/1</blockquote>\nMy notational thoughts aren't really consequential, since this is electronic, and the score was only for my own ease of composing, not for performance, but I've always thought of it as Calliope's section in 4/4 and Dirk's in 13/16, so when they start to combine, it's 4 (Calliope eighth notes) against 13 (Dirk sixteenth notes)\n(<i>original track art</i>)\n<img src=\"media/misc/narrative-command.jpg\" width=\"772\" height=\"772\">\n<i>Ana:</i>\nI believe the real protagonist of this song is Jade Harley.

Even the same symbolism can be found in other pieces: Theseus streaking across his face, shatters of memories lost to space. Mine started to mutate though, to take on a form beyond my control. My skill to render the memories failed me: WIPs show the corpse of John, the beheading of Dirk, other fragments of the Epilogues. The main decisions of the piece happened spontaneously: fragments of a clock reforming to Dirk's silhouette, Theseus moving from the corner and taking its place as Dirk's glasses. The colors went through many iterations, a volatile photoshop file of hue shifts and stacked filters. The final nail in the coffin for any hope of a semblance of normalcy in this came with my most baffling decision of all: splashing my previous two track arts for UMSPAF over this one. My original monochrome draft for Diverging Delicacies' \"Dirk's Dreamers\" became the only shattered memory, a destruction of art I birthed but am not fond of. Moons of Theseus' \"Unchained\" merged with the fibers of space, a celebrated giant looming over all my other pieces. Much like the man this art is focused on, the very piece itself has become a distractingly shiny mirror reflecting the artist's self-indulgent nonsense.

In the end, I didn't really do many different concept sketches for this one. I knew that I wanted a scene of Tavros, in his Peter Pan outfit, staring out as the friends and army they'd worked so hard to gather get eaten by the black hole. The ghosts are just as much the ‘Lost Boys' here as Tav is himself. I was going for a ‘wistful, but resigned' sort of feeling for this, since all Tav can really do now is watch. He knows he's unable to stop everyone from being destroyed—or, as we know now, getting pulled into the new HS^2 universe.

Most everything in the picture came out naturally, with a few tweaks here and there. I had John looking looking sad in one iteration, but I felt it didn't match up with the more upbeat nature of the song, so I changed it. I did sort of trip at the finish line when adding details to the buildings in the background.

Lake:</i>\n(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/spellbang/status/1249755343615393792\">Twitter</a>)\nmight fuck around and release some stuckhome syndrome music today...\nby that i mean i'm definitely releasing some stuckhome syndrome music today. if all goes well i'll probably have it up in like...maybe a little over an hour?\nno promises but you know. i am just a little creacher\n-\ni wasn't technically lying\n(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/spellbang/status/1250780820287164419\">Twitter</a>)\nmight as well talk a tiny bit about this song, Four Kids (and a Game They Played Together), since people are responding to it way more strongly than i kind of expected\nthe original version of the track from yeaaaaars ago i wrote as an instrumental i intended to be the \"homestuck end credits theme,\" which ended up not panning out for a bunch of reasons, but the song was always a fave of mine, and stuck around on my hard drive until i polished it up as the finale of the main portion of Stuckhome Syndrome P1V1. i still love this version of the song very much.\ni had a vocal version brewing in my head for ages. literally from before stuckhome syndrome was released. i mean, the first line (it's been a little bit since the last time we all talked/so how are all of you doing?) was just a sudden thing about me getting volume 10 together\ni never had anything besides that opening line, though, not really. for ages i thought i'd finish it up for the last stuckhome volume (i haven't even put the 2nd together...but i will! this year probably?) but a lot  ended up hitting me in the interim and i didn't have time for it\nabout five months ago i was contacted to be a part of the homestuck 2 music team and was told the lowdown: it was a clean slate, and a chance to establish the musical rockbed for homestuck 2 going forward. no quotes of hs1 songs whatsoever, but we'd be making new songs TO quote\ni messed around with a few other demos but it was pretty quick for me to settle on deciding to do this. since four kids was never actually released as part of homestuck proper, it ended up feeling like the perfect time to pull the track together for real.\nthough the instrumental of the new version came together with steady work over the past few months the actual vocals and lyrics didn't coalesce until about two weeks ago. i had messed around with dozens of variants until then; the only stuff finalized earlier was the chorus\nsinging it was fresh hell because it's stretching my range extremely hard, but i didn't want to do pitch correction. on the final track there is some on the backing vocals for two parts, mostly to help finish the thing quickly, but the majority of it is natural\nit was endless, endless retakes and it still sound bad to my ears but i think the roughness maybe helps the emotional quality of the song? i guess?\nfor my part, i'm just glad it's done and i'm glad it's apparently good. anyway. thanks\noh and lastly i guess speculate all you want about the meaning of the song but i'm not going to engage with any of that stuff because i kinda feel like what the song is feeling is clear without my input on that front\nbut. yeah. thanks again. <3\n<i>Star-nomad:</i>\nWhile this piece is canonically about the composer, listening to it made me strongly think of John, specifically from the Meat timeline. Since the title of the song basically encompasses John's life during Sburb and by extension his fight with Lord English in the epilogues, I wanted to do something reminiscent of these ideas. Thus I went with the idea of some of the last remaining dream bubbles, and how they show pivotal points from the game session that John was apart of or would remember. I decided to also go with different color palettes, but each having a similar enough scheme that the bubbles showed cohesion. It was a very fun piece to work on, and is hopefully symbolic enough of John and his memories!\n<img src=\"media/misc/four-kids-and-a-game-they-played-together-wip1.jpg\" width=\"448\" height=\"448\">\n<img src=\"media/misc/four-kids-and-a-game-they-played-together-wip2.jpg\" width=\"441\" height=\"441\">\n<img src=\"media/misc/four-kids-and-a-game-they-played-together-wip3.jpg\" width=\"441\" height=\"441\">",

This has undoubtedly been the busiest year (or two) of my life, and I am only now returning to reacquaint myself with what the heck is up.\nMalcolm wrote the chiptune version of Showtime first. I heard it, dug it, and created a piano arrangement just for the hell of it. Like Malcolm has said - earlier on, we didn't necessarily know what we were writing for, so we just wrote whatever spoke to us. I had posted a \"Work in progress\" version to the music boards, and I received some positive feedback. Positive enough for me to elaborate it into a full piece. As luck would have it, Andrew was finishing up the first playable page of Homestuck just as I posted the full version. As such, I was lucky enough to have the honour of first musical appearance in Homestuck, but most of the credit should certainly go to Malcolm - for defining John musically at such an early stage of the game, and for being the sole inspiration behind this track.\nOh, side note: My midi keyboard was misbehaving when I wrote this, so every note of the piece was clicked into a sequencer.

Since it was still early on in the comic, I decided to do it in an 8-bit style, and I figured that I could make remixes of it later if harlequins still turned out to be important in the comic. It turns out I didn't have to very much, since a lot of the other music team ended up remixing it! It still stands as my most favorite 8-bit melodies I've written.",

        "commentary": "<i>Malcolm Brown:</i>\nProbably the first bit of music accepted for HS (The piano version came afterwards but was used in the comic earlier). Difficult to fully recall what was going on with this one, but from what we knew about John at this point (i.e. Bit of a prankster, likes his movies) there was something about the name and the melody that just fit.\nEarly on in HS Music dev, Andrew would basically announce \"Need boss music for upcoming battle: go!\" and we'd all whip up some music and present it. These days that doesn't happen any more (larger team, ludicrous amount of already made-but-not-used music) but back then it was a fresh slate. I personally whipped up 3 30-second 'Looping boss battle music in the style of NES chiptunes' as per the original request. (I think it was Andrew's idea to start things off chiptune style and we've been evolving since)\nThe other 2 unused tracks (Which I still have somewhere) were ok - One was very piratey but quite sinister, the other was incredibly evil sounding, but Showtime had that initial-boss 'fun-ness' to it and apparantly just hit all the right notes.\nThe melody itself is very simple: It's just a square wave doing some broken chords. For the album version we were told to add some bits to the loopable tracks to make 'em 2 minutes long and have a proper ending, so the album features an intro and second part with a little solo.",

This was when the music team's main scoop on the kids was that they were going to have theme instruments that somehow function as their weapons or special abilities as well, although I guess this has only mostly come to fruition with Dave's turntables. Well, I'm primarily a violinist, and Rose's instrument was to be violin/strings, so this was right up my alley. I love just randomly improvising on the violin, exploring different poetic areas, if you will, and coming up with things that sounded beautiful to me. At this time in particular, I was doing that a lot. Hadley's Aggrieve was created first in this case, and I had roughly dictated it, so I knew the notes. I fooled around with it a couple of times, playing with a haunting/sad-but-hopeful tone, and the arrangement that you hear was recorded literally the first time it was played - the first time those notes were played in that rhythm, tone and order was the same time it was recorded. That version, cut, is what you hear in the comic. I reverse-engineered the sheet music from my own recording to do a recording for the album. Unfortunately, I was, and I suppose am still today, new to the recording game, and so there are mistakes I cringe at in both the comic and album versions. Gabe Nezovic's mastering helps to cover most of it, but I still feel kind of guilty about it. Oh well.",

    "commentary": "<i>Veritas Unae:</i>\nIn 2011, some musicians got together. They had an idea, to grab together some of the many pieces of fan music floating around the MSPA forums and the internet, and compile it into an album for the fandom to download. I can remember excitedly heading to my second semester classes at university listening to the tunes that these fantastic artists had provided, and the track art to go with each song. I'm so glad to have worked with most if not all of these musicians along the course of the past 3 years.\nI got my own chacne to participate in these endeavours in 2012, with the fan musicians coming together to work on Sburb OST and LoFaM 2. And now we're here, in 2013, releasing LoFaM 3 for you all. I hope you love each and every track on this album, much like I remember loving LoFaM in 2011. Many thanks have to be extended to everyone who brings these projects together, most of all Lune, who has handled everything art for the project! I couldn't have done it without her. Thanks to Brad for making the booklet, AndrewNeo for hosting all this fan music for us, Xzaz for being incredible at picking tracks and references, as well as the brave sacrifices he has made for the album, and to Solatrus, Konec0 and Mark for helping along the way.\nThanks for listening!\n- Veritas Unae\n<i>Christina Lillard:</i>\nSo this sure is a thing! I did art for LOFAM2 and retconned in a nice banner for the rehosted LOFAM1, so naturally I sold my soul to the LOFAM once more to draw things and wrangle some artists for the third album! I consider this project a tribute to the creative side of the Homestuck fandom. You guys rock! I hope yoiu enjoy this album and take a look at all the cool art for it.\n- your friendly neighborhood Lune\n<hr>\n<i>Special Thanks:</i>\n<b>-CONCEPTION/ORGANIZATION-</b><br>Lune (Artist Wrangler)<br>Veritas Unae (Musician Wrangler)\n<b>-ADDITIONAL ORGANIZATION-</b><br>Brad \"Avinoch\" Griffin &lt;- thanking myself<br>Catboss (Catboss)<br>Mark Ciocca<br>Jeremy \"Solatrus\" Iamurri<br>Lambda \"Xzaz\" Blesdoe<br>...and everybody who nominated songs!\n<b>-MASTERING-</b><br>Veritas Unae\n<b>-<small>YET ANOTHER</small> COMMENTARY BOOKLET-</b><br>Brad \"Avinoch\" Griffin &lt;- twice\n<b>-WEBSITE CODE-</b><br>Veritas Unae\n<b>-WEBSITE HOSTING-</b><br>AndrewNeo and skaia.net\n<b>-INSPIRATION-</b><br>Andrew Hussie &amp; What Pumpkin Studios<br>The Homestuck Music Team<br>The Homestuck Fan Musicians",

Though there aren't enough free pages for an epic tale like last time, I figure I can find something to put to fill in the blanks.\nSome cool time-reversal effects in this track.

I really enjoyed drawing Jake and Jane's face. Drawing Derse and Prospit was quite the challenge but I hope I managed something recognizable!

Such angles only occur when two planets are in two signs next to each other; in this case I'm referring to Cancer and Leo. The song (and image, for that matter) both follow this concept of 'togetherness', no matter what may face them -- and you'll see that The Disciple keeps her promise, as she is found in our night sky beside the prophet Cancerian.\n<i>Brad Griffin:</i>\nDon't see much art or songs for the Ancestors.

        "commentary": "<i>Willow Ascenzo:</i>\nDance of Viridian and Violet is an oldtrack of mine--about two years old! I was surprised anyone remembered it enough to nominate it for Land of Fans and Music 3, but I suppose I should never underestimate people's willingness to dig years back through a fanartist's works. Anyway, like I said, it is very old and absolutely no mastering was used on it whatsoever (I'm scared to actually look at its waveform) since back then I didn't know what mastering was. The song ended up sounding quite beautiful, and I sitll think so today, despite my relative lack of skill.\nOf course, this track being so old, I'd long since deleted the original FL Studio project file during spring cleaning, so I didn't have access to any of the MIDI data (the same thing happened with [[Sign of the Scorpion]]). I couldn't even properly remaster the song since I no longer had a lossless source. That's why I made a brand-new arrangement of the piece for LOFAM 3 that captures the piece's ouriginal beauty and romantic feel while only adding to its richness and elegance. Both Dance of Thorns and Endless Climb are hinted at in the composition, and while there aren't any quotes from Alternia/Bound, the stately elegance of the piece is meant to recall Kanaya.\n<i>rosesarecrimson:</i>\nThis was a piece where I had the concept from day one. I knew that the piece ought to be ballet-inspired, given the prompt. Grimdark Rose and Kanpire were aesthetic choices - I wanted their duet to be balanced, with neither one taking the background role, and the duality suited the theme nicely.",

As for the title, well, I'm thinking of a number between 450 and 850...\n<i>sayanchan-art:</i>\nThis music gave me a ton of inspiration for the track art but I ahd to draw a lot of different things and concepts before I actually came down to what I really wanted. For starters, Sburban Jungle has always been the music that kick started the game for the kids. For a beautiful track like this I felt the need to be a bit more abstract, so as the kids rise up, they bleed this colourful and glitchy glitter and the image itself follows the sequence of the Zodiac Signs (Trolls amde the kids), Green Spirograph (Beta Kids session) and the game reset which amde the Sburb logo red (Alpha kids session).",

So the idea is that Dirk and Jake are adventuring together on lomax with Sawtooth and Squarewave (who are providing the hip hop backdrop). I imagine Dirk would be very controlling during tomb raids and such, taking the leader role, or at least being manipulative in some way. I think this would really make Jake feel uncomfortable and.... (wait for it) uncertain about his feelings towards Dirk. I think the song's vibe really matches this as well with the cool electronic instrumentation (Dirk) and the walk around looping anxiousness of it (Jack and his adventuring).",

At the time this song was created, I had no recording equipment other than a mic on my webcam (and I actually used that same thing to re-record the vocals). Since the audio quality was incomprehensibly bad, I ended up messing around with equalization and limiting a lot, and because of that, I had to change the song to compensate. It went from a more acoustic song, to a song that used a lot of percussion, to even chiptune at one point. It finally settled on this pad-synth kinda' style, and I'd say I'm pretty pleased with that.\nExcluding the actual production, hte subject and title of the song, \"Medium\", really stood out to me while I was making it. The Medium holds all of the planets, all of the life, and all of the excitemnt of S___b. Actually, it holds everything that there is about the game. So, I wanted to make the song sound vast, but I also wanted it to be a bit more personal. Maybe \"vastness of the mind\" could be a good description. All in all, I'm satisfied wit hthe osng, and I hope whoever hears it will be as well.\n<i>Scarodactyl:</i>\nI really enjoyed working on this one. Trying to get the entirety of The Medium into the canvas in a coherent way was an interesting challenge.",

What was originally just another remix suddenly became one of my most well known and recognized songs! It all started when I saw an interesting post speculating what instruments the trolls might've played. There was harp for Aradia, there was guitar for Tavros, and for Terezi it had clarinet. As soon as I saw that, I knew I had to do a jazzed up remix of her theme. So for about two days, I transcribed the melody, worked out some chords, and did up a bassline and drumbeat. It was kind of weird working on this song, since I was using the unconventional 8/4 time rather than 4/4 time. The reason for this was to make the eight-note swing sound like sixteenth-note swing. Although I'm not as much into Homestuck any more and I feel as though I've written better songs since then, I am still pleased that a lot of people liked this song!\n<i><b>Brad Griffin:</b></i>\nThis track was actually slated to be on LOFAM 2 originally, but got pushed back for some reason or other.

Given that it had been months since the whole team had made a new collaborative effort, I took no time in repaying the album several times a day for weeks after its release. As you might expect, this kinda gets into your subconscious. And one night, I had a dream. I was in my room, listening to Trepidation. Then... actually, I'm pretty sure that was the whole dream. When I woke up, I begain thinking about what the dream could have meant. My conclusion was that I should probably listen to Trepidation some more. And I did. And it ended up becoming my favorite Homestuck song.\nAbout seven months later, I reminded myself about the fact that the LOFAM 3 project was probably about to start soon. Resolving to make a quality song before the selection process began, I decided to make a Trepidation rearrange, given that I practically knew all its notes by heart by then. So I opened up FL studio, and began working nonstop for the next day and a half to finish it. It ended up quoting not only Trepidation, but also Negative Aperture, Miasmajesty and Upwards Movement, and I'm pretty proud of the end results!\n<i>Yorick Cobb:</i>\nThis picture started out digitally as an attempt to imitate N's original placeholder, but I had to restart it when the pen on my tablet wore down. Because I am more comfortable with physical media, the piece was free to go in more interesting directions.

This one follows a similar vein; Her Imperious Condescension vs. Lord English's Handmaid. I wanted the track to show how tired of life the Handmaid had become, so a lot of her motifs get cut short quite abrasively by HIC's \"attacks\", as it were. She puts up a little bit of a struggle sometimes, but eventually she just accepts her fate and lets herself be replaced.

Like [[Dance of Viridian and Violet]], I'd long since deleted the project file, since it was just a one-off Homestuck song that I figured I was unlikely to ever need again, so I made a nwe arrangement of the piece from scratch, taking elements I liked frmo the original and putting them in a new context. It doesn't quote any Homestuck themes (I don't believe the original did at all), except for a brief mention of Spider's Claw right at the end. The new arrangement has a bit more of a hard-rock feel and toned-down orchestral elements, making it a bit more reflective of Vriska as a character.\n<i>Ducky Senpai:</i>\nI did a track art for one of Ascenzo's songs back in LOFAM2 as well and also the art for [[Rust Apocalypse]]. So, when I saw two songs by them on the available songs for track art, I couldn't really help myself. Their songs are great. I know you like it, I can tell. Hope the track art seems suitable, and that you'll enjoy that as well. I have nothing else to say on the matter. That's it.",

I originally set out to make this piece for a Hero of Light, mainly for Rose at the conception of the piece, but as I got further into making it, it became clear it was not a \"Rose\" song. Although I think this song goes off on too many tangents (not sticking to a particular melody or motif throughout the song) I find it suiting for Aranea due to her tendency to jabber away at any chance she gets, often changing the subject multiple times. Or maybe I just made that up now to make it seem like I did it on purpose...The world may never know. I have also been thinking about making a sort of \"sequel\" set of songs to this one for Vriska and Rose. They would be called \"Fortune Stealer\" and \"Fortune Teller\" respectively.\n<i>Elanor Pam:</i>\nAranea.",

I really connected with James's piece, so much so that I made sure to let him know (and continue to let him know) how easy and intuitive it felt to play. I experimented with it, transitioning into psych0ruins, and then into Doctor. Being heavily inspired by Konec0's dance medleys, I thought to extend the piece, and extend it I did. Up until the Walk Stab Walk / Earthsea Borealis section was all ad lib'd on my piano, as I picked pieces I thought I could move between, and beyond there I wrote original scores straight into Sibelius which I could barely dream of playing. This piece developed into what you hear today, including the seret ending! I hope it moves you, as all of Homestuck's music has moved me. Enjoy listening to this 31 song medley! Some day I'll learn to play it.\nA 'quick' fact, I had planned to continue the Killed By 8r8k Spider section through over the top of the Unite Synchronization ostinato, but when I played back the section after the high G, stacatto F into the ostinato, I felt a powerful urge to just get straight back into the final version of Eden, which was written on whim straight into that 4/4 pattern and more fluidly in B minor. It feels like a new life has been breathed into Eden because of it, and I'm so happy to be the man to have done it!\n<i>azuzatori:</i>\nscoot did piano<br>i drew piano",

I tried to follow Jit's carefully integrated elements of Doctor to discover that his method employed a much more flowing and intertwined realization of instrumental melody; this was something I felt tha I did not achieve. I felt refreshing to observe what can only be described as mastery of melody, theme and atmosphere. It was a pleasure to make this piece.\n<i>Elanor Pam:</i>\nSketched and colored in Paint Tool Sai and color adjusted in Photoshop.\nMY WORKSPACE TABLET IS INCREDIBLY SHITTY I AM SO SORRY CALLIE DESERVED BETTER THAN THIS also I actually forgot about Dirk's sword and only noticed it when I was about to post haha whoops",

I started with the drums, which were just an attempt to create a kit from scratch that I didn't entirely hate, plus a ton of reverb. Next came the atmospheric elements - the distorted tremolo synth, the piano, the echoing synth bleeps which to me are a signal intended to guide the player, decayed over the aeons the planet has waited for Dirk's arrival, and the nearly-metronomic hat-click to reinfore the senes that, now that he's here, his limited time is rapidly ticking away. Finally I tried a few string melodies for the middle section, but simply nothing says 'towering ancient remains of a lost civilization' as effectively as Erik Scheele's Ruins, so I stole it and added a sort of contrapuntal harmony underneath. And now I give it to you.\n<i>fueledbyanimation:</i>\nI was beyond excited to get to be part of another fan album, especially to be drawing for a song connected to Dirk's planet, since he's one of my absolute favorite characters. Every kid/troll's planet reflects them and also challenges them at the same time. LOTAK is one of the more dangerous planets, with its constant raging lightning storms and the most powerful denizen at its center, fitting for Dirk who is a determined, skilled fighter. The planet is also a contrast, a planet full of tall buildings for someone who grew up in an ocean surrounded by nothing. I really wanted to show LOTAK as an extension, or part of, DIrk himself. The song itself gives a sense of floating, or as the musi artist said themselves, a very spacey feeling, so I tried to capture this as well, with the overview shot of the planet that Dirk appears to be floating over. I hope that others who look at my piece will feel I managed to pictuer the song well in my drawing for it.",

It's synthesized entirely with FM patches ripped from a ROM of Sonic The Hedgehog 2 and converted to FM8 format, in keeping with the Sega Genesis inspired style of Dirk-related songs like [[Anbroids:anbroids-v2]]. The rhythms in this song were largely inspired by the drums in the song \"Tung, The Icelandic Lesbian\" by Kitsune^2. I've always been a big fan of heavy 6/8 two-against-three rhythms played with Sonic-style drums, so the choice of time signature for this track was a no-brainer.\n<i>melodiousDiscord:</i>\nHere we see Dirk, the Prince of Heart, preparing to clash with the Imperial Drones sent by HIC to dispose of him. His loyal and steadfast retainer, Sawtooth, seeks to thin the enemy ranks while Dirk meets the opposing force head on. A fierce and devastating battle ensues, yet the Prince prevails. For now...",

And with my love of psych0ruins and Liquid Negrocity / Black leading me to sessions on the piano playing around with the song, a steady chain of events started forming as I played around with the medley. Imagine the events of Aradia's half of [S] Wake playing, plus those pages that come a little while after where Aradia stops Jack in time (note the 'ticking' of the high notes late in the piece!) Of course, I had to pay homage to the original track used for the flash. What you hear is played live, too! (albeit through a MIDI keyboard) Many thanks to Lunatic again for providing assistance - it's insane the air this guy's got.\n<i>Lauren:</i>\nSince Aradia came back to life she's been entertaining nuts, and I had this image of her sitting with a calm smile on her face while Jack is trapped and PISSED. I thought it would be fun since Aradia takes everything so in stride, and when she first becomes God Tier she freezes Jack mere seconds before he kills her, with a big smile on her face and no worries. I wanted to go with something like this, Jack being trapped in 'time' and Aradia sitting by sweetly.",

He's been a very supportive friend and music-making mentor and I couldn't imagine working with a better collab partner. I was tossing the idea around for a while to do something for the Draconian Dignitary / Diamonds Droog, so I was very happy when Joe went along with the idea. It turned out a lot different than I expected, but in a very good way! I'm pleased as punch to have been a part of it.\n<i>Joe Ouellet:</i>\nThis was a collab between me and Cullen! I had a ton of fun working on this with him. It was his idea initially to mash up a few songs featuring DD. I didn't really expect it to turn into a dubstep piece as I had no experience making the genre at all!\n<i>plaidcushion:</i>\nI wanted to go with a simple but striking design that worked on two levels: the large diamond with the grey layers, which looks good as a thumbnail on a small ipod screen or similar, and the silhouetted shadowy type DDs that are more apparent when you view the art at full size.

The most obvious sample is from \"It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing\", but other samples in there inclue the trumpet from an old 1940s big band song, and the drums from \"Paint It Black\" by the Rolling Stones. For a song that wasn't even originally a song, I think it came out pretty well.

The beginning is supposed to be happy; the beta kids finally unite for the first time after a session gone awry and a 3 year journey through the dark abyss and a mysterious alternate dimension. They hug, cry, fist bump, push each other down a set of friendship stairs, etc. Then Rose drops a bombshell: an unbeatable demon is going around destroying dream bubbles, and in the process, the universe. Things look grave, and Jade and John are startled. But they decide to press on and not give up. Together, with the remaining trolls and the alpha kids, they can defeat, or escape, Lord English once and for all.\n<i><b>Brad Griffin:</b></i>\nDue to miscommunication, we actually ended up with a couple pieces for this track. Both were pretty rad, so we didn't want either to go to waste. The other ended up being the [[Disk 2:disk2-lofam3]] track art.",

Every piece of track art I've done for this album has been a little different. This one was the easiest to do and only took an hour because this kind of inked comic book art is my bread and butter. I felt that something bold and comic bookish would fit well since it has that epic kind of scope prog rock gets across.

We got talking about the fact that Frost had been remixed a couple times (once by us, and [[the other:meltwater]] by orngje223). One of us (probably Nick) wondered what Frost would sound like as a really cliched remix, to which Jeremy sarcastically pointed out that the only people who ever remix Frost is himself and his friends. This idea was, obviously, a total joke; nevertheless, we kept at it. The song ended up getting to a point where we realized the joke had been lost, and something awesome took its place. To put it simply, what started out as us dicking around ended up becoming one of the coolest songs we've done together.\n<i>devonianecho:</i>\nDoing art for a dance remix of Frost wouldn't have proved tricky if not for a perplexing (but very cool) track title. And so, here we have Jade and some frogs integrated as part of a... metaphoric-circuitboard-type-thing by Echidna. I think if you imagine the song set to a trippy frog-gathering montage on LOFAF with this imagery, you'll get a better idea of what I was aiming for. At any rate, I'm really happy with how it turned out, and I hope I've done the track the justice it absolutely deserves.",

This track (which is based around the Exiles years in the future) and one other are actually only the third and fourth tracks i ever composed! I've improved alot since then but I always had a little bit of love for this one. When LOFAM3 was announced I made a snap decision to spruce up my little deser themed tune and bring tumblr's attention back to it. I'm honoured that such an old track of mine is still considered worthy of LOFAM, to be honest!\n<i><b>Brad Griffin:</b></i>\nThat heavenscape is certainly sunsoaked. Neat!",

Prior to completing it in March 2012, I had really only been making small loops in FL Studio that only had one or two instruments, save for two submissions I'd sent to the Homestuck fanmusic contest, which, while pretty good in terms of structure even by my standards today, didn't exactly have much to them in production value. But when I took it upon myself to rearrange Explore, that suddenly changed. I was extremely self-deprecative about it at first, but as I began to listen to it more, I realized that it didn't sound all that bad- in fact, it even sounded.. tolerable, compared to everything else I'd made. And that was essentially when I resolved to work on making my music sound even better.\nIn fact, people liked it enough that it was nominated for LOFAM 3, no more than a year later. Having improved a lot by that time, I decided to touch it up a little, and this version is the result. I didn't really change all that much, besides adding and tweaking a few instruments, but I hope it sounds better nonetheless.\n<i>Christina Lillard:</i>\nMy interest in doing Homestuck fanart has waned over the past few months, but I will always have a soft spot for the exiles no matter what. So it is only natural that I do goofy exile art for an Explore arrangement! Even though I was seriously burned out on art in general when I did this, I think it turned out okay.

However, when I listen to it now, two years later, I realize how little I knew about Famitracker, and music composition in genearl. I like to think I've learned a great deal since Ohgodboss.

Enjoy!\n<i><b>Brad Griffin:</b></i>\n<small><small>oh for the love of god!</small></small>\n<i>Kate Holden:</i>\nI actually did two pieces of potential art for this, both featuring Dave and Jade fighting Bec Noir, since it seemed appropriate for an intense boss tune featuring a theme associated with Jade. There was a duller version of this as well as a more comic bookish one. A panel of friends agreed that this one read better, but it was a little flat, so I started brightening it and tweaking it, but still wanted to convey '8-bit', so I started playing around with a square brush throwing in this Darwina-esque square noise, which I thought looked pretty cool. It has been remarked that Jade firing an assault rifle in the air in front of a volcano is metal as shit. That's probably my favourite commentary on this image.",

The jagged textures of quartz crystals provide a nice backdrop when paired with the howling, almost glowing sky. There's a ton of detail put into every area of this piece, and that's especially noticable in the Aradiabot occupying the left of the composition. Her damaged and decaying appearance helps to add to the unsettling nature of the piece. Aradia herself is also visible in the art as well. Isn't it a little weird that these two different versions of Aradia are in the same piece...? Then again, if there was ever to be a troll that showed up in two places at the same time, it's her.",

I started composing it with the little kalimba riff and added from there. I was excited to create a song using instruments that I actually play, and most of the song is acoustic - but time constraints proved to stop me from getting good ocarina takes for the lead, so I scrambled at the last minute to find a replacement and ended up using touch control erhu on my iPad! I wasn't and still am not completely satisfied with the melody, but I felt better about it after I incorporated a version mostly in the pentatonic scale along with the original version, which was then used as a development. I think my main inspirations for this song were the tea and Asian-looking mountains of Nepeta's land, as well as the \"snowy\" landscape.\n<i>TheChaoMaster:</i>\nThis is painted in acrylic, as I was inspired to paint more after finishing my high school major work which also focused on backgrounds and landscapes. I thought it would be good to try my hand at a fantasy setting. Lolcat is a very cute land and is very bright so I incorporated both of those aspects into my piece. The acrylic paints also match the acoustic song.\n<b><i>WHATISLOSTINTHEMINES:</i></b>\nhuzzah the nine kettle pots we<br>on sugar we rest on you see<br>friends of the cat<br>nothing wrong with that<br>now shut up and have some damn tea",

So I started again (Sorry CJ!!). By that time CJ had more or less finished their cover art for this track though, so I decided to take inspiration from that, and wrote a piece supposed to sound like a string quintet playing by the ocean at night. I had an idea for a viola line, which I built as the main melody, and later realising how well [[track:frog-forager]] would work with it (especially, you know, because of all the frogs), I had the second violin play that melody while the first follows it as sort of a canon. Then I got writer's block. Then [[album:ancestral]] happened, and I instantly came to love Skip's track [[track:theotokos]], so I built a section around that, too. The title was suggested by Kal-la-kal-la around the same time I finished it.\n<i>Circlejourney:</i>\nThe Land of Rays and Frogs is, to me, one of the most aesthetically pleasing lands in Homestuck, with everything submerged underwater and beams of light ascending like infinitely tall pillars from the sea. That, coupled with the incomplete version of the track that Grace had shared at the time, made this an easy pick for me.\nI did my best to capture the grandeur (as I picture it) of the Land of Rays and Frogs in my illustration for this wonderfully serene piece of music, focusing on reflections of the light rays in the water, which this track brings to mind.*\n*This is only accurate assuming Power doesn't completely rework it considering it's an unintentional Magicant arrangement.",

I have the map, and I steer the ship.\" -Garnet, Steven Universe\nThe above quote is a pretty succinct summary of why I decided to name this track Delta Divination. River deltas are where the flow of water exits into a (generally) larger body of water, whether an ocean, sea, lake, or something else - just like the narrow path of the present branches and exits into endless streams of choices and possibilities. As the planet of the mind player, LOTAF facilitates thinking about each and every direction as its own river delta. Also, LOTAF has rivers too! There's a non-abstract justification for ya!\nThis track let me do a bunch of things I'm always happy to experiment with, like using 80s synths with radical pitch bends, smooth guitars and bitcrushed drums, so I'm glad I got the opportunity to work on it. I made certain parts of this track represent \"clearing the mind\", in a sense - note how the drums get far less bitcrushy after a certain point, for instance. Also, what kind of loser references their own song??? Pshh, I know, right. [[track:retconjuration]] gave me an opportunity to narratively represent the idea of \"making your own luck\" though, relevant to the apotheosis of Terezi's journey as a mind player, so that's what counts in the end.\n<i>Chumi:</i>\nIt was super fun drawnig for Delta Divination, thank you to the music and management team for putting this together!\nI love Terezi, as much as I never draw her... and I also love drawing landscapes!

        "commentary": "<i>Blackhole:</i>\nSelecting LoCaS for my track presented me with a challenge of how to compose a track for a land that has silence as one of its elements. Thankfully, the theme of caves gave me something to work with, and I decided to lean into the soft, echoing quality of underground spaces. I decided that the best way to convey the \"silence\" would be to have a slowly building intro defined by subtle sounds and silent breaks, with the melody coming in as a subtle echo that slowly builds to crescendo. I tried to give the lead instruments a diffuse, echoing quality to carry on the theme. I'm hoping the builds and silent breaks give the desired effect without ultimately being too minimal and drawn-out. I felt that dripping water was another strong but subtle scene-setting sound element. It also gave me a sound concept that I used for the glass bells, which I tried to give the same feel while building to an arpeggio-style melody to give the track some velocity. Most of the time I spent on the track probably went into arranging the bells, as a lot of thought had to go into the note placement, and I ended up having to compose the part twice after I realized too late that the first version didn't sound correct alongside the main melody. In terms of influences, I think the piece takes some cues from one of the slower pieces from the Pirates of the Caribbean soundtrack, particularly for what became the cello section. Oh, and of course I couldn't write a Homestuck track without including at least a nod to the OST, so I snuck in a little bit of Indigo Heir at the end for Equius during the final contemplative fadeout. Overall I'm pretty proud of this track, and I hope you enjoy it!\n<i>Cosmic:</i>\nI had lots of fun working on this piece, and the input from others really helped me learn new ways to do things and helped the piece come together to what it is now. I feel that the hardest part was making all the pieces of the art meld together into one cohesive and nice to look at image. I hope everyone listening enjoys the song and the art, and I hope they like the album as a whole as it was put together with help from all sorts of talented musicians and artists whom I respect greatly.",

At the time, when I was tossing around ideas for what a theme for LOTAM might sound like, I happened to keep going back to the same thing. Magical stoner guitar, baby. Zilly as it must sound, I thought it would make for a neat song. Entreated by this concept, I started work. Enter me doing something a little more different from what I made at the time.\nIssue: I needed to shoehorn in an ICP reference.\nSolution: I would ask Cait for an ICP clip to shoehorn in, which she assisted by sending me clips of Miracles that were flanged beyond belief, thanks.\nAfter adding on several horn samples over an actual clip, I automated the tempo, so I could have a lurching vibe to that section, and I could get started on the song proper.\nBasically, I wanted to create something that had a slight uneasy vibe to it, but was otherwise an easy listen. As it happened, I thought guitars run through many, many flangers would be a nice way of achieving that. Doped up sounding instruments would sound fairly not-high-Gamzee-y, I thought.\nCan't say I had much of a plan beyond that. Hate to plan out absolutely everything in advance to be quite honest. As I first added drums, I thought of using noise channels, but was too lazy to actually find good settings, so I bit-crushed normal sounding drums as a placeholder. Rather than change it later on however, I found that the drums already worked quite well as normal fucking drums, so I kept them as is. After that, I added a synth arpeggiation, which much much later at the suggestion of SplitSuns I put an automated pitchbend over, which might be a <i>little</i> hard to hear in the final mix, but eh. Can't particularly say anything that more interesting about the production. That about wraps it I'd say. Even though this song is fairly old by now, I'm still fairly happy with it. Rather works well for the subject matter, not to toot my own horn.\n<i>genericDragon:</i>\nThis piece was a bit of a challenge for me, since landscapes aren't really my strong suit. This was also my first contribution to unofficialmspafans. To me, the song had a kind of dreamy, hazy feel to it, and I tried to reflect that the best I could in the artwork. LOTAM is an interesting land, and I had a lot of fun drawing this. I hope that you guys will all enjoy this song as much as I did!",

At the point when I was deliberating over which land to make a track for, I'd already composed music for both Meenah and the Condesce, and I thought it'd be cool to complete the fuchsia troll set.\nFor me, oceanic (or more generally watery) scenes bring to mind a classic piano + string ensemble setup, with the strings laying down a serene backdrop and the piano's broken chords calling to mind the refraction of light through waves. I had a flute play the melody becaus I relate flutes to glass (y'know, wine flutes...) and also because they're fantastic at carrying slow melodies over more hectic instrumentation.\nThis piece was a real pleasure to compose; it came very naturally and took me about three days in total. Back when Ver iwas still planning on doing a dream bubble medley to close the album, he asked that we give our tracks distinct melodies, and I promised that mine would be heartbreakingly beautiful; I'm not sure I delivered on that promise but I do think it sounds pretty sweet at least.\nAs for the title, \"hyaline\" has two meanings - \"resembling glass\" and \"clear sky/sea\" - in other worsd, the perfect fit for Feferi's aquarium-themed land. It's also a fairly simple but uncommon word that I figure would make it easy to remember.\n<i>allyssinian:</i>\nI wanted to show off the feel and personality that Feferi and her planet share, to go with the light music.

        "commentary": "<i>Malcolm Brown:</i>\n<b>The Concept</b>\nSo with Cherubim, we tried something a little different to reflect the duality of the character/s in question.  The album would be split into an even number of tracks grouped in pairs, and then finish off with Eternity Served Cold, to represent Caliborn’s dominance and unchaining.  The pairs would represent a similar track done in two distinct styles for Calliope and Caliborn - Calliopes tracks would be considerably mellow, light, friendly, while Caliborn’s versions would be chaotic and angry.\nCarne Vale mirrors RJ’s “Stellarum Salve\" though only vaguely - I probably could’ve done a better job, but hopefully there’s enough recognizable lapses into SS that I treat as Calliope’s personality sorta coming back into the fray.  The noticable sections are 0:00 and 1:58. Outside of that, anything pretty much went - The original ideas thrown about were a kind of crazy, OTT DnB. I ended up combining that with quite a bit of angry metal guitar, and a few spoonfuls of English (And Eternity, just for a bit of foreshadowing).\nOriginally I was looking into the Saw theme for inspiration, since there’s quite a lot of decent connections to be had there (Not least because of Caliborn’s escape sequence and the whole Lil’ Cal thing) - in the end I didn’t really use much of this, which is a shame because it’d probably work quite well…\n<b>The Name</b>\nThe name for this guy actually has more backstory than most.  The working title was “Caliburninate”. Afterwards I thought “uNCHAINED” might make a nice name, since the progression of the song made it seem an almost alternative version of Caliborn’s freedom/leg-sawing. adventure.  Trouble was, Eternity Served Cold already provided the background to that, and it’d make more sense to rename EsC to “uNCHAINED” than this one (as pointed out by Toby).  So that idea was dropped and still no name.\n(Also, while I considered renaming EsC to ‘uNCHAINED’, I figured that guy’d been renamed enough and people were already referring to it via the ‘Eternity’ name, so I figured just leave it).\nFinally I looked to the whole ICP/Juggalo angle.  Latched on to the name “Carnival”, but that on its own was a bit flat, so went looking into the etymology of the word.  Dug up “Carne Vale\" (lit. ‘Farewell Meat’) and that was that.\nIt bizarrely managed to be a sort of weird mirror of “Stellarum Salve”, and be almost appropriate to the whole leg-slicing shenanighens.\n<b>The Track</b>\nNow, there was quite a lot of DmC being played while I was making this, so a lot of of inspiration came from both the new Devil May Cry and the original ones.\nWe start off with a minor-ised version of a sequence from Stellarum Salve, before bursting into the rising power-chord section.  This is you’re typical “transformation” section where Caliborn’s personality is beginning to take over.  Of note for this song is the usage of Shreddage, which I’ve been fiddling about with after Toby posted about it a while back.  My setup for using it isn’t brilliant, but the Amp sim it comes with is decent enough and the recorded strings and general setup (i.e. easy support for double tracking and the like) are probably better than anything I could do with a real guitar.\nAt 0:45 we bring in a direct reference to Eternity/English.  (The melody is English, the music box in the background is referencing the beginning of Eternity). Can’t quiet remember what I was doing for the synthy-bass in the background, but I do remember it was fairly distorted.  The laughing here I’ll talk about a bit later...\n1:10, and Shreddage is paying for itself with a meaty bit of rhythm guitar.  Probably could’ve done a bit more variation around these sections, but it was doing a good enough job.\n1:57 gives us the second Stellarum Salve reference, sort’ve mashed two bits together.  Here we have a brief reprieve from the chaos as Calliope’s personality resurfaces.  Then however, we get to the noisiest bit of the whole song.\n2:27 and we get ready to go into full rave mode. Once the beat gets going, I decided to try a more complex riff for shreddage, a mix of power chords and lead. The synth bass also gets a bit more to do, adding a bit of panning and the then pitching it up to play a crazy arpeggiation.  This bit was basically just “do something crazy”. Originally I had some laughter here too, but took it out since it was being drowned out by everything else.\n3:02 and we return to a bit of sanity.  The guitar solo here is again provided by shreddage and sequenced - It’s actually fairly simplistic, but adding a few articulations helps fool it into sounding a bit more believable.\n3:26 and we bring our old friend Fruity Slicer back into the fray.  He’s simply slicing the beat that was used throughout the song previously, while the rest of the song calms back down to another reference to English.  Once that’s done, we bookend the whole thing with another reference to Stellarum Salve - Caliborn’s off back to sleep and we’re returning to Calliope again.\nNow, a few other interesting things about this track (That a few people have already spotted) - firstly, it actually uses quite a few samples that come with FL Studio.  Namely the percussion and the laughter.  The percussion was pretty much the only example I had for the kind of drumline I was after, so it was fine.\nThe laughter was an interesting example - It’s from one of those collections of samples of voice that are usually terrible and added to 90s dance tracks (Shouting something random if its a male voice, like “CHECK THIS BASS!!” or “YEAH!” and moaning something incoherent if it’s female like “Oooahhhawoooahhayeah!”.  Pitched up it sounded creepy enough when layered.  It’s a bit cliched, but it works.\nAnd that’s Carne Vale.  An angry little shout from a little green, malevolent angel-baby. Grr. Argh.",

        "commentary": "<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>\nI floated the idea for a UU + uu album last year in about June as a concept record divided in half with equal and analogous parts Calliope and Caliborn. While we really wanted to jump in and get to making more Homestuck music following Volume 9, we decided to wait and discover more of the two characters until December when Radiation re-organized the effort. He proposed the Jekyll / Hyde alternating pace of the album culminating in “Eternity Served Cold” and had the group split into pairs, each musician working with a partner on a track with the same themes and motifs.\nI worked with Erik, who sent me the at-the-time unfinished Calliope composition “Constant Confinement\" for me to base my Caliborn track around. Erik’s track was so meditative, it was actually difficult to recognize the slow-paced woodwind melody over the course of the piece, which pulses onward without any strict meter. This melody had to be expanded upon a lot to match the pace of \"Constant Conquest\" - it actually flies by at breakneck pace in the first measure of the piece before settling into its groove.\nConquest in many ways resembles [[Ruins Rising]], another electronic track based around one of Erik’s piano compositions. Like in my approach to “Ruins\" I arranged the melody sparsely and created a very dense environment of drums and percussion sounds to convert Erik’s pulse into a groove. Same input, same solution, although this time I went much, much heavier than ever before. I had a handful of different drum kits going all at once, each with unique effects chains, to create more of an ensemble sound than a clean dance beat.\nWhat really sealed in the atmosphere of this track was the huge slather of pads that adorned the track, most of which were created using analog equipment. I fed the signal from an old Radio Shack keyboard with basic midi patches through a pawn shop guitar pedal to create the many layers of sound that fill the background. Some of the most excellent sounds on the track (especially that snarling synth at 2:57) were created by hammering the mod knobs and wah-wah pedal while playing atonal pitches. The result is distorted synth excellence.",

        "commentary": "<i>Malcolm Brown:</i>\nFirst off, a thanks to the folk who enjoyed EsC.\nSecondly, the above question’s been asked by enough folk now that’s worth commenting on. Specifically, a) Will I release the original and b) Why is it different.\nSo let’s get a) out of the way: Most likely - I won’t release it right now though, as that’d diminish the album release. Somewhere down the line I’ll release the original version with the original mixing, and possibly the cut ending part (Which was cut because it sounded silly :p).\nNow for b):\nGetting the first bit out of the way, I’ve a long way to go with learning mastering properly. What sounds ok on Headphones A might sound too bass heavy on Headphones B, absolutely lightweight on Speakers C and generally terrible on earphones Q. With a bit of effort, understand and the right equipment or software the process can be considerably better (I’m using various Dynamic Range monitors to check loudness, for example). I’m still fairly naff at it.\nNow, Eternity’s one of the more complicated tracks I’ve done - It’s got quite a few opposing voices: a synth orchestra, synth and heavy percussion, rhythm and lead guitar voices, pianos, wooden and metal toned percussion, timpanies, creepy sound effects, various choirs with various articulations and so on. Getting all these noises to sound halfway decent on top of each other might’ve been a bit beyond my current skill.\nWhen I passed the first version to Rad, he noted it was a bit quiet compared to other tracks. A few variations later (Some bass reduction because a lot of my tracks are a bit bass heavy, I blame my default headphones which have very little bass), then it was a bit anemic. Brought the bass back, tried to bring in some of the voices that were being drowned out (This is the biggest problem people have with the newer version - Some of the strings have been reduced in favour of other voices, notably in the Revelawesome section). Long story short, I didn’t have a decent setup that lets me make any mastering decisions with much confidence.\nThere’s also a few notable mistakes in EsC in general - Firstly, there’s simply too much strings. In some sections, there’s a high string melody, with staccato strings, more strings below that, and a cello/double bass strings bit. And a solo violin on top of that. It’s simply too much string section fighting over control of what’s going on - This was the main reason for trying to bring the french horns and oboe back into the fold. Additionally, I’m not convinced I’m using panning to its best, resulting in a very squashed mix that’s very central and doesn’t sound “spacial”, which a bit orchestral track really should.\nMastering EsC highlights that there’s large gaps in my skill for music production that I need to brush up on. This is good - It’s always good to have targets for self improvement. I’ll say right now that both versions are still considerably better than Rex Duodecim Angelus :p And essentially it’s the same deal - A synth-orchestral romp through a Homestuck medley meant to sound mean and imposing and threatening, so I won’t say I’m not improving :D.\nTL:DR: Yes the old version will be released at a later date. It sounds different because I’m wishy-washy at mastering. (I’m not actually sure if I’m using that term right, I’m basing it off Peanuts)\nHope that answers ya'lls questions :)\n(<a href=\"https://dragonxvi.tumblr.com/post/28573051810/eternitys-shylock-a-short-commentary\">Tumblr</a>)\n<img src=\"media/misc/04681.gif\" width=\"650\" height=\"450\">\nI’ve been getting a lot of questions about this guy, so here goes:\nIt’s commentry time!!!\n<b>The track in general</b>\nIf you’ve been paying attention to this blog, I already hinted at the development of ES.  It’s kind of a “Sequel” to Rex Duodecim Angelus in that it’s a gradual Medley of HS tracks arranged in some kind of sinister Boss Theme.\nThe track itself is split into 3 “Acts”.  Act I acts as a kind of intro and goes from 0:00 to around 2:30 (As the Revelawesome section begins).  Act 2 is the conflict, and ends just after “ the party is defeated” and the music turns a bit more sinister around 4:40.  Act 3 is distinctly missing from the flash, but deals with the heroes comeback and eventual final conflict and resolution.  The Flash ends just hope is beginning to peek through.\nThe obvious inspiration and basis for this track is <b>Toby Fox’s “English”</b> and it’s meant to be a track for LE ‘imself.  As the act structure implied, it was designed for a battle with LE vs The Good Guys, but ultimately works as a “LE is doing something incredibly nasty and you guys better stay away!”\n<b>The track in more detail</b>\nI tried to be a bit more cinematic in my orchestral arrangement here.  It’s far from perfect, but it’s better than previous attempts.  Gotta keep pushin’ yourself I guess.\nStuff you should be able to hear:\n- [[Sburban Countdown]] (At the start and occasionally in other places)\n- [[English]] (Should be obvious)\n- [[Revelawesome]] (ARound 2:40)\n- [[Black Hole / Green Sun]] (Twisted a bit, but after the Revelawesome section. The music box makes it noticeable, and 'English’ is playing on top of it)\n- [[Endless Climb]] (Subtly added at 3:37)\n- [[Ruins]] at 4:03\n- [[Penumbra Phantasm]] and hints of the finale of the SotDD section in [[Cascade]] at the end.\nStuff you didn’t hear because the track ends before it gets going:\n- [[Doctor]]\n- Quite a bit of guitar\nSo why make another Medley fest? Quite a lot of the HS themes blend really nicely together, and we can associate a lot of events and memories with past flashes (Revelawesome was used as a kind of gag, but here’s it more sinister).  I do like a good Medley, and judging from the reaction of Descend, RDA and the latest Solo Album, you guys do too!\nThe track was made in FL Studio. It mostly uses SoundsOnline EWQL VST libraries, namely:\n- Symphonic Orchestra\n- Symphonic Choirs (Shouty choir girls)\n- Goliath (For some of the larger percussion and sound effects)\n- Ministry of Rock (Guitar, some percussion and bass guitar)\nAnd a few soundfonts.\n<b>When is it available?</b>\nGood question! I suspect you’ll be waiting for Volume 10 to show up, which'll materialize after the solo albums and once we’ve got enough Cherubim goodness for you.\n<b>The Name</b>\n“Eternity’s Shylock” is an odd one I’ll grant you.  It’s alternative working title is “Eternity Served Cold”.\n“Eternity” should be obvious. He’s a time travelling demon after all.  \"Shylock\" is a bit more confusing and that leads us on to…\n<b>A bit of controversy with the name</b>\n“Shylock”, as many of you know, is a character from “The Merchant of Venice”.  Specifically, a rather antagonistic Jewish Moneylender.  You can <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Merchant_of_Venice#Shylock_and_the_antisemitism_debate\">read all about the antisemitism debate on the WIKI page</a> but long story short, the character of Shylock has quite a bit of controversy surrounding the portrayal of the Jewish.\nNow, from the name “Shylock” it’s also a slang term for “Loan Shark” - One who loans money yet charges extraordinary amounts of interest and threatens those who cannot pay the return.  It was used in 20th century gangster/Mafia slang, and that’s where I pulled it from as a nice fit to Lord English.  Therefore “Eternity’s Shylock” - One who gives time, only to take it back with interest.  It’s a bit of a stretch, but in the end it sounded like a nice name - Mildly sinister, yet grand.\nNow, my use of the term “Shylock” in this context is that of a Loan-shark. There’s been plenty of portrayals of this profession, particularly in crime dramas where one character gets in deep with one and they send round “The boys” to break some fingers etc.  The name “Shylock” in this manner refers to the profession and behavior rather than the character or his religious beliefs, but I can fully believe why some people would look at the name “Shylock” with disgust, given the controversy surrounding him.\nThis was my bad in lack of research, and I apologize.  There was certainly no insult meant if it was received.\nHowever, it should be clear to anyone that Lord English, a time travelling threat to all existence, is not in any way implicated to be Jewish.  No more so than the implication that he’s from England and has a seat in the House of Lords because of his name.  He’s a green, skeletal Mafia pimp demon who flies through time in a crazy sarcophagus and vomits rainbow laz0rs.\nI may be [mis]understanding the original controversy surrounding the issue, but from what I read it implied that Shylock the character and Lord English were one and the same, and that Homestuck was presenting a parallel to tMoV.  The link is… Well I may not be the finest literary analyst in the world, but I don’t buy it in the slightest.  And even if it was a genuinely well thought out analysis, I’d be delighted to be told exactly where in Homestuck it is implied that Lord English identifies himself as Jewish by his words or actions.  Or at which point Shylock vomits lasers all over the dream ghost of Antonio.\nSee, it sounds absurd.  Fan-speculation is a large part of the Homestuck community, but sometimes it can get a bit icky when it dives into issues of race and creed.  You’re thinking about it too much, it’s a webcomic about some crazy stuff. Just chill.\nhonk HONK.",

        "commentary": "<i>Solatrus:</i>\n<i>(original commentary)</i>\nHm, I haven’t thought much about Prospit & Derse since its release, actually, but, here goes.\nAs you can probably tell, the two halves of the album have some parallels, especially in the first two songs: e.g., Hallowed Halls is to Darkened Streets as Golden Towers is to Obsidian Towers. I originally wrote Darkened Streets, but I really wanted to take the melody and progression used in it and apply it to a brassy fanfare. That’s ultimately what Hallowed Halls came to be. Honestly, if it wasn’t for Mark helping me name the song, I probably wouldn’t’ve had the right image in my head for the new arrangement.\nAnd Nick Smalley helped me out with those french horns, making them sound halfway decent.\nNot really much else other than this song and Core of Darkness are without a doubt the best two on the album.\n<i>(commentary redux)</i>\nThe opener for Prospit & Derse, at least, in the album’s final lineup. This was actually track #5 for the longest period of time, but I realized just before release that Prospit had a stronger opening track and Derse had a stronger closing track.\nThis was a really fun song to create, and definitely helped set the example of how I wanted to approach Prospit for awhile. Hilariously, if you listen to how the album’s set up, there’s actually 4 sets of songs. Hallowed Halls and The Golden Towers have a lot of similar instruments, and are both designed as parallels to Darkened Streets and The Obsidian Towers, which also have a similar set of instruments. I ended up veering off into totally unique territory for each half’s Dreamers, and ended up continuing in those new directions for the 4th tracks.\nA big thanks to Nick and Mark for helping me get this particular track started. Mark gave me some good ideas (as well as naming this song) for how to put together some of the melodic lines. Nick came along and pointed out how I should use the French Horns. So this track is almost completely why the two of them have special thanks credits on this album.\nIn retrospect, the song feels like it’s a bit empty. For being what’s supposed to be the Royal Palace of Prospit, the impact just isn’t there, neither melodically nor atmospherically. It’s not a bad song, but it just barely misses the mark that it deserved to hit.\nHowever, I absolutely adored the art Bea did for this piece, and, well, .. hey wait the art up there is different than it used to be! Yup. Bea decided to update the art for Hallowed Halls, and she did and even better job than before. Oh, and here’s the fun part on this: I had no idea she actually was doing this until a few days ago, and she forgot that the anniversary was yesterday! Anyway, here’s what she had to say:\n(<i>Bea:</i>)\n\"contributing to homestuck, a webcomic thats given me so many opportunities, friends and good memories is a great honor, especially to be involved in an album as conceptually compelling and well executed as the prospit and derse album. i thank solatrus for the opportunity to be a part of his creation and everyone who helped me give back to something that has influenced my life immensely.\"\nThanks for helping me out, Bea. And keep up the good work.\nI have to say I’m pleased overall with this song, but, like any artist, it’s difficult to look back at my works. They never seem completed. Especially the Prospit half for me.\n(<i>original track art</i>)\n<img src=\"media/misc/hallowed-halls-old.jpg\" width=\"700\" height=\"700\">",

        "commentary": "<i>Solatrus:</i>\nOh boy. ...What to say on this one...\nThat probably frightens you a little, doesn’t it? Yeah. Well, putting it simply this song tried too hard to be The Obsidian Towers. I really wanted to do that parallel idea with this song and its Derse counterpart more than any of the others, but I ended up trying too hard to pull off that effect. And this song suffered greatly for it.\nTo be fair, it’s got a pretty cool twist on everything compared to Obsidian Towers, but the biggest problem with this song is that I didn’t try to let it be itself. You have no idea how badly I want to redo this song. There’s so much potential behind this song that, at the time, I really just didn’t understand. Of course, I’ve learned a remarkable amount since then, and one day, hopefully soon, I will rewrite this song.\nHaha, I sound like I’m really tearing into my work here, don’t I? Well, it used to be Prospit Dreamers that I didn’t like, but more on that a little later.\nAs I mentioned with The Obsidian Towers, both songs suffer from being really boring compositions. While Obsidian managed to get away with it because of my production skill, this song couldn’t hide behind ill beats and a deliciously dark atmosphere. So, the very inexperienced composer in me tried his best to piece together a song based on The Obsidian Towers.\nIs it horrible? Eh, I’ll leave that judgment up to you. I know there are fans out there who really dig this song. My opinion is that it’s my weakest song related to Homestuck, but really, it’s not the worst thing I’ve ever done.\nI’m quite pleased with what Pride did for the art, though. It worked out really well for the song.\nAs an additional note, it’s been pointed out to me by <a href=\"http://kicking-christ-in-a-dirty-diaper.tumblr.com/\">this fan</a> that this song sounds like it has Mark Hadley’s Problem Sleuth theme in it, at least in part. It’s a coincidence in the exact same reason that Frost gets the same comment: slow melodies, probably the same key. Really nothing else to it. I’ve listened to Hadley’s PS theme probably twice ever. Oops. Said fan also wondered if I jokingly thought that gentlemen of Team Sleuth are Prospit’s agents much like our chums in the Midnight Crew are Derse’s. I didn’t, but that’s an awesome comparison and now I’m all for it.",

It was rushed, and it’s, sadly, my least favorite work I’ve ever done. I had some interesting ideas, going with a bit of a swing flavor to it, but frankly the song sounds like I was going through ADD.\nIt probably doesn’t help that I basically [wrote] a small, but significant, part of the song and set it aside for a few months before adding in the piano and bass parts and finishing it.\nAnd by rushed I mean I was actually adding to this song days before the album came out. I wouldn’t recommend anyone doing that ever.\nStill, people seem to like the song, and to be fair, there’s a few really neat parts in it. It’s just, well, weak overall. I’ve done a lot better, and this song’s ‘failure,’ so to speak, taught me a lot of valuable lessons.\nSorry if you were expecting something more positive!\n<i>(commentary redux)</i>\nThis song is freaking weird.\nNow why do I say that? Well, it doesn’t really know what it wants to be. A 6/8 piece somewhat reminiscent of something from the Legend of Zelda? A 4/4 piece? A swung piece? It’s... well it’s all of those.\nProspit Dreamers is without a doubt the most ambitious song I wrote for Prospit & Derse. I did a lot of really awkward things that worked out really well, but I had absolutely no idea why any of it worked. And so I ended up really hating the song because I thought it was too random!\nCome a year later and I now I understand my composing style better, so when I listen to this I find it to be a pretty dang fascinating piece. A lot of individual parts making a very interesting greater whole.\nIf you think about the early part, it sounds like the Prospitians had created this really mellow 6/8 piece, but then John and Jade show up and mix it up with their (my headcanon) love of swing music.\nI’m especially pleased with how I managed to fit Frost and Doctor together into this song, along with a little bit of Penumbra Phantasm, and still make the song stand on its own. It’s a lot cooler sounding than what I did in Derse Dreamers, honestly!\nMy personal favorite part is the time signature switch when the clarinets come in and play an arrangement of that familiar motif from Penumbra Phantasm, and then the strong french horns playing the same line they played in Frost behind the trumpets playing Doctor’s melody.\nIt’s really hilarious how I used to not appreciate this song, but now I do. I actually enjoy it more than most of the album, and I’m really glad that my opinion changed, and I am also really glad I asked Zoey to do the art for this song, because her art is amazing, and her interpretation of John and Jade is the best. THE BEST. Speaking of, she informed me to tell you all the following:\n(<i>Zilleniose:</i>)\n\"Butts\"\nButts indeed.",

B)\nWhile this song was started pretty late into production, it was actually one of the first in the entire album to be completed. Both Hallowed Halls and Center of Brilliance were started around the same time, and I really don’t remember which came first. It’s been awhile, okay?\nAnyway, if it wasn’t one of the first to be completed, it was definitely the first. I’m actually pretty pleased with this song, because it helped me figure out the other direction I wanted to go in for Prospit.\nThe best part about this song is, without a doubt, the trumpet lines in the middle and near the end. While it’s totally synthetic and sampled, I’m very pleased with how it sounds! I really love the section very close to the end where it’s just a single trumpet and the clarinet section. It’s one of the better motifs I’ve written, in my opinion, and I’m quite pleased with it.\nThat’s not to say this song is perfect. The piano timing is a little too off and a little too noticeably cut-and-paste repeated. It’s a really tiny nitpick, but I didn’t even really notice it until earlier this week.\nOh, and in case you didn’t know, this song was originally Prospit Dreamers. Why did I change my mind on it? Well, I couldn’t figure out how to fit in Doctor (and by extension Penumbra Phantasm) and Frost into such a happy sounding song. It just wasn’t really working for me, nor was the time signature.\nBut I definitely felt like the song was a great closer to this half of the album, and Shelby’s art for the piece fit perfectly.",

        "commentary": "<i>Solatrus:</i>\nThis was definitely the song that started everything off. It’s dark, dreary, but still majestic like the very moon it describes. The music takes on you a flight. You’re one of the Derse Dreamers, the wind rushing across your face as you approach the moon’s surface. Carapaces scurrying about, too afraid to be caught after curfew, wary of Jack Noir and his gang.\nMy original goal was to make this song set the example of how I perceive Derse. Dark, but not evil. Fitting for the Dreamers we know and love there.\nI definitely tried to go into some new territory with this song. While I’ve always loved the Metroid Prime Trilogy soundtrack, this was my first real attempt at trying to imitate many quality’s of that trilogy’s music.\nThe violin that comes in pretty early on was actually added in near the end of the album’s production, and the idea to really strongly associate every song with the kids didn’t occur to me until part of the way into doing Prospit’s half, but I’ll get to that later.\nI really have to say I like the the bass I chose for this song. It has a sort of heart beat quality to it. Very simple, very deep. But it really cuts through. Of course, I did get to do my favorite high pass/bitcrushed beats again, but this time I did a spin on it: Gross Beat. I mentioned it with Crystalanthology, but I used Gross Beat far more extensively in Derse.\nWhen I was initially creating this song, Prospit & Derse was a concept album. You, the listener, would have been guided along a journey, first to Derse, going through the Darkened Streets, up the Obsidian Towers to where the Derse Dreamers were jamming out, before heading deep into the Core of Darkness, until you were suddenly transported to Prospit, appearing in the Hallowed Halls before repeating the journey with Prospit’s counterparts. Honestly, if you listen to the album as Derse & Prospit instead, you still can kind of get that vibe!\nYou can definitely hear the idea of that in how it goes into The Obsidian Towers, but I ended up removing the more seemless transitions in favor of just having two somewhat parallel albums, and stuck with the parallel idea for awhile. This is the most obvious in the first two songs of each half. Hallowed Halls is based on Darkened Streets, and The Golden Towers is based on The Obsidian Towers.\nIn a side note, I’d love to link you to the artist who did the song cover art for Darkened Streets, but I’ve lost contact with them! If anyone knows where I can get in contact again, please let me know!",

        "commentary": "<i>Solatrus:</i>\nI started to shift styles for this one a bit. I wanted something that was more majestic sounding, but still as dark as Darkened Streets. Ultimately, I decided to feature the choir section more in the intro. It actually was probably the first synth I put in this song. Everything basically followed.\nI had a bit more fun with the bassline in this song, though it’s not particularly complex. The focus definitely on the time shifting beats, a la Dave. Hell, Dave is the main reason I decided to use Gross Beat heavily. I wonder if Dave feels like a Time Lord as the Knight of Time?\nThe Obsidian Towers was actually one of the last songs I finished composing for the album, because I got totally stuck on it without having the string section in there.\nAnyway, I think this song definitely describes the Towers well enough, though, I feel like I could have gone for something a bit more powerful in sound. Something more looming, more... ominous. Oh well. Hindsight is 20/20, yeah? To be fair, The Golden Towers suffers from this issue as well, so it was probably also a composition problem. Woosp!\nNonetheless, the string section in this song, especially right at the end, is one of the cooler sounding harmonies I’ve thrown together.\nI really have always loved the architecture Andrew picked for the moons, though personally I feel it fits Derse far better than Prospit.",

        "commentary": "<i>Solatrus:</i>\n<i>(original commentary)</i>\nWell, this is the most popular song from Prospit & Derse. Not surprised it eventually would show up. :&gt;\nThis song, along with Core of Darkness, captures the very core idea I had in mind for the Prospit & Derse album: writing music about the settings, but showing that the mere existence of the kids on those moons influences the music as well.\nDerse Dreamers was the first to actually reach that goal, and was actually the first song to be fully completed on the entire album.\nOf course, this song being retroactively tossed into the Shut Up and Jam page helped with its popularity quite a bit.\nRetroactively gaining an additional featured song... from a page that existed before my first real feature. How’s that for weird time shit?\n<i>(commentary redux)</i>\nThe fan favorite. Without a freaking doubt. This one compares to Frost in popularity, and I’m willing to bet is probably even more popular thanks to horizon’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9SQjvPLAWs\">vocal cover</a>.\nWhat’s that? You hear Iron Man in it? Yeah, so do I. Oops. That string section is kind of hilariously similar. It’s a huge coincidence, though, because I really don’t listen to Black Sabbath whatsoever.\nWhen I started this song, I knew I wanted two things: Rose playing violin, and Dave being a bad-ass with time-shifted beats. I ended up making the opening motif and let it repeat for most of the song. People seemed to really like the strong focus on Rose and Dave, but I think even more so people enjoyed the callbacks to their respective Medium world themes (Endless Climb and Atomyk Ebonpyre, respectively).\nThough, maybe it was the name? Maybe it was the amazing art Mixt did? Speaking of, here’s what she had to say:\n(<i>Mixt:</i>)\n\"I recall the idea was to draw Rose and Dave jamming on Derse, but the piece itself made me think of space, so they ended up jamming in the space between Derse and its moon instead. Rose’s bowhand unfortunately reflects my own terrible grip when playing violin.\nAlso, I laughed when it was discovered that Derse Dreamers made it into [S] Rose and Dave: Shut up and jam just prior to the album’s release. Fandom, you never cease to amaze me.\"\nI agree with her there. I was very amused when people noticed the change to that page even before I had the chance to mention it to anyone. Crazy fandom ninjas!\nYeah, that’s pretty much all there is to this song. It was remarkably straightforward. I didn’t do anything particularly surprising for myself on this one. I knew exactly what I wanted to do, and I did it.\nMore importantly, however, I’m thrilled this song is enjoyed by so many people, and I’ve been blown away how people have have been using this song in their own derivative works. It’s just really heartwarming as an artist to see my work out there having a life of its own.",

        "commentary": "<i>Solatrus:</i>\n<i>(original commentary)</i>\nBest song on Prospit & Derse. Period.\nThis was the song that made me realize my production had legitimately hit a professional level and wasn’t ever going to go back.\nThis was the only Derse song that was written in response to a Prospit song. I wrote Center of Brilliance before Core of Darkness, and I really wanted to try to counter the very.. bright and circular (I guess?) feel I had with CoB.\nOut of all of my production work, Core of Darkness has the most movie soundtrack sound to it, and that’s pretty awesome. Fantastic way to close out the album.\nIt’s also a nice precursor to my current interest in trip hop music.\n<i>(commentary redux)</i>\nMy favorite. While you all have a soft spot for Derse Dreamers, I have one for Core of Darkness. This is the song that made me actually say out loud, “Whoa, when did my music start sounding professional?”\nYeah. This one. I had more fun working on this song than any other song on this album. And it still stands out to me as being one of, if not, my best electronic/downbeat songs. I wasn’t really sure what I was going with when I picked the name Core of Darkness. This song doesn’t particularly have a “round” feel to it, amusingly. But I wanted to just grasp the raw essence, the core, if you will, of what Derse is, and continue with the idea that the kids influence the way the music sounds on the moons just as they affect many of the characters in the game through prototyping.\nI’m very pleased with the string sections I did, though it’s not really a complex melody. Lots of repetition, just like the rest of this half of the album. But the atmosphere is pretty damn awesome, and without a doubt set the tone for some of my future works. I wasn’t aware that I actually really liked trip-hop at the time, but Nick introduced me to the genre, and it completely clarified why I enjoyed doing this half of the album so much.\nI’m also very impressed with the art that Shad did, though it wasn’t exactly what I had in mind. However, I preferred to let the artists have some free reign, so this actually turned out better than what I was thinking! Here’s what she had to say on her piece and the rest of the album:\n(<i>Shad:</i>)\n\"When I was first asked about doing album art, it was really, really exciting!! Those who know me, know that I’m all about the carapace and everything in general, and having an album based on the kingdoms was really exciting and it was an honor to be confronted about it at all!\nI’ve always dreamed to do things for Homestuck, just because of how it has affected me. I’m always up to doing things, and it’s always greatwhen I’m allowed, and when it’s something that I feel passionate about.\nI did the album art to Core of Darkness, which honestly is one of my favorite songs and I can’t tell if I’m being biased or not because it’s my art.\nI took the chance to do something new, and I wanted to go above and beyond what quality work that I normally do. I wanted this to be something I could be proud of, and something that would showcase just how good I thought it was!\nSolatrus sent me a sample of the unfinished song, which I listened to on repeat the whole time I was working. I ended up doing the wholething in one sitting, and I just worked on it all night long because I was just.reallyinto it. I wanted to do somethingreally extreme and fun to look at. The angel being. like.. you were in the core, a la the title of the music.\nI can’t tell you how many times I wanted to just give up andscrap it, because it was hard and something I hadn’t done - the perspective, along with the lineless-like style.\nBut I’m really happy with it even a year later.\nThe music itself was just.really really great. I loved itnot just because I worked on it, which was a great plus, but all the art, allof it, was really great. The music was awesome, and I loved the whole thingbehind it. Using the kids’ instruments and styles to create the music for each kingdom. And just??? It seemed really fitting, what with how much I like thecarapace and all.\nIt was really an honor to work on it, and I still listen to the album every now and again, even a year later. I’m really proud of everyone who worked on it and thankful for the album and the art.\"\nAw, thanks Shad! I really appreciate that you enjoy the album so much.",

        "commentary": "<i>Solatrus:</i>\n<i>(original commentary)</i>\nAh, yes, Swing of the Clock. One of my better songs. Also the first song I wrote after joining the team!\nIf you didn’t know, Swing of the Clock was heavily inspired off of both Clark Powell’s Three in the Morning and various Philip Glass musical compositions. It was my first attempt at doing something with a lot of orchestral instruments, though definitely far from my best orchestral composition.\nIn retrospect, it’s a bit of a boring song with its chord progression, but I’d be damned if I didn’t say something about the shift from Philip Glass style clarinets to swung synth rock. I was very proud of that contrast.\nAlso a lesser known fact: It was actually considered for a flash animation, in a similar vein to Alex Rosetti’s Squiddles song. But, due to the difficulties in organizing a full song animation, especially one that was twice as long as Squiddles, it was just impossible to do realistically.\n<i>(commentary redux)</i>\nAh, this song. The memories.  Not really any pre-song history so I’ll just get right into how it was created and why I took this song in this direction.\nSwing of the Clock, henceforth shortened to SotC (not to be confused with Shadow of the Colossus! It’s just a hilarious coincidence) was the first song I started writing after joining the team. Multiple fake band albums were in progress (The Felt and Squiddles), but at the time I had no idea how to even approach Squiddles (see last week’s post ([[Squiddles in Paradise]]) for details).\nSo, I decided I’d try to do something orchestral. I went with a few ideas, but for some reason I kept wanting to write a song with a swing feel in it, though that’s more Midnight Crew than Felt, yet at the same time I wanted to do something that was clearly Philip Glass influenced. The small scraps I started before finally settling on a starting point (none of them were saved, sorry!) all shared two major common pieces: a ticking clock, and an arpeggio piano inspired off of Clark Powell’s Three in the Morning.\nBoth are still in the song, though amusingly many people didn’t notice the piano. It’s there. In reverse. :D\nWhile I was messing around with the early ideas for SotC, I managed to create a nice sounding bass synth, but I ended up replacing the sound with a couple of clarinets to keep the focus on orchestral instruments instead.\nI knew early on I wanted to write a song with a very slow progression, very gradual and subtle shifts between sections. However, I wasn’t entirely sure how to approach it until Beatfox [Seth Peelle] made a suggestion on the forums about mastering and production as a whole. Before this song I tended to have a bad habit of improperly using compressors and limiters, though I definitely knew better than to use FL Studio’s stock setting for the Fruity Limiter. (Not saying the Limiter is bad, it’s just really horrible in what the default project template gives you.)\nWhile SotC isn’t the first song I put a significant amount of effort into controlling the mix, it was the first I really managed to succeed in understanding what I was doing in that area of production.\nI ended up automating everything in the song, and I realized how much easier it was to fulfill my original idea plus improve on my overall production. Sadly, the song was still very much on the loud side compared to the rest of the album, so there were some problems with how it was mastered in the end.\nGoing back on track with the swing feel I originally intended… As you can tell, the song is in a 6/8 time signature. It’s one of my favorites. It’s not a true swing, but it was close enough to get where I wanted.\nA true swing is lazy 6/8. Sort of.\nAnyway, so while the first third of the song is pretty strictly 6/8, the drum beat comes in that’s definitely swing influenced. And during that section, there’s the tuba part. Well! That originally was actually a stand up bass part, but there’s really no way to mimic a stand up bass with sample libraries, so I experimented with a bunch of sounds until I settled on the tuba.\nIt was passable, but only after I shifted it to actually play slightly early. The attack was so slow.  It was a little frustrating.\nAfter that, as you know, it goes into the heavier synth rock section. Oh, hey, remember that bassline I said I scrapped in favor of the clarinets? There it is. Back in its glory.\nThe fun big moment, and then the song fades away.\nStill one of my best songs in the Homestuck canon. I felt like I had set a new standard far higher than I’d ever be able to reach, but being on the team has pushed me further than I ever expected.\n<b>Now For Some Trivia!</b>\nSwing of the Clock was the second to last of a very long stretch of original songs I did in the key of F minor. It’s my favorite key to write music in, but I’ve barely touched it since Chartreuse Rewind. (Which is next week..! Er.. I guess this week, since I was late on this. Oops.) Why? Well, too much of a good thing is a bad thing.\nSecondly, Lexxy really dug this song and it made me flip the fuck out when I found out she liked it, because she’s an amazing person!",

I loved the music box-esque remixes on Volume 5 even more.  Before I got on the team, I had written Clockwork Apocalypse, an orchestrated version of Clockwork Melody.  After realizing Audacity could reverse music, I started experimenting.\nSince the Endless Climb melody was so memorable and it had served as good sort of interlude tracks on Volume 5, I decided to try to make something in a similar vein.  Oddly enough, I think the reversed version of the Clockwork Reversal sounds even better than both Clockwork Reversal and Clockwork Apocalypse.",

It’s not nearly as strong of a song as Swing of the Clock, but it still has its interesting moments.\nOriginally it was a song called Ascension that I was writing outside of Homestuck. Amusingly, it was inspired off of the work from the Felt, but it was a little too electronic to really fit the album’s overall atmosphere.\nLong story short, I remixed Ascension into Charteuse Rewind and, out of hilarity, Ascension itself was scrapped. So, the remix of one of my songs survived and the original did not.\n<i>(commentary redux)</i>\nTo start off, I did not expect this song to make it on to The Felt.\nWhy? Well, it’s not nearly as good as Swing of the Clock. I didn’t think I deserved two songs on the album (versus other pieces that didn’t make it), but nonetheless, that’s what happened.\nSo, where did this song start? Well, it started as inspiration off of The Felt but also from my interest in drum and bass music. Yeah. This song sounded very different at one point. As in, in my head, as a concept.\nI never actually did make the version I originally set out to create, instead I made something that kind of sounded like the final version, except a bit more focused on the electronic stuff (e.g. the second half of the official release).\nThis song’s name came out of a subtitle I was using, because this was the remix, not the original. The original was called Ascension, but it ended up getting scrapped. The other peeps on the team started to reference this song as Chartreuse Rewind alone instead of Ascension (Chartreuse Rewind), and the name stuck.\nWhat else… oh, I really love bass clarinet. Before I met Marcy Nabors [she] told me she really liked to play the bass clarinet part. And she actually has played the part for me. Not like it’s difficult.\nAll of my work repeated itself way too friggin’ much back then.\nThere are pieces here and there that are in reverse, yet forward in the chord progression (the xylo, for example, though it ends up flipping turnways in wibbly wobbly time near the end).\nIs it a bad song? Oh, no. I’ve made worse. Far worse. But it isn’t particularly an amazing song, to me, anyway. I guess a lot of you liked it, though, and that’s all that matters. :D",

Shortly after the melody plays, it stops and rewinds back to the beginning, adding more instruments and speeding up the song slightly. This repeats until it is barely the same song anymore, fast and furious instead of the simple cello and viola duet that it starts with. After all the parts are in place, the parts start dropping out one by one until it goes back to the simple start. I went with the abrupt sound of a tape recorder instead of something more subtle, because Eggs and Biscuits aren't know for their subtlety.",

Basically what happened was: I am visiting somewhere in Chicago with only my phone’s connection to the internet, check the MSPA forums and find a message notification waiting for me.  Radiation congratulates me on getting on the team.  After some moments of sputtering disbelief, I read on.  He says if I want to get started on something, the Squiddles was being finished up and the Felt was on the table.  So, for the next couple hours I was invigorated, consumed wholly during the car ride and time in the hotel before I finally fell asleep with working on a track for the Felt.  Time Paradox was made.\nOriginally, I made it imagining the recruitment of the Felt, picturing Doc Scratch warping across time and space, assembling the green goons from who knows where, and then witnessing the construction of the Felt manor.\nIt’s a fun track, more energetic than a lot of things I had worked on and definitely influenced by Radiation’s style.  The last two sections are still some of my favorite phrases that I’ve written.",

It was for the Homestuck Fan Album, which actually turned out to be 2 albums lol.  So yup, I entered, and I was one of the winners, in fact it’s actually the first track (track 1 is an opener)... I’m kinda astonished by that today, but I guess it fits!\nAbout the song, I called it Cosmic Surgeon because of John and that big drill thing he did... And the whole cancer thing.. So I guess the song did kinda cater as a theme for him already.  What a coincidence that as soon as I make a remix, I can enter it into a contest right away and it actually wins.  When I wrote it, I just really wanted to capture how the entire comic made me feel at the time, especially after watching Cascade.  It’s a theme for John, but I also think of it as kind of a real “Homestuck” theme for the entire thing, I guess, as a lot of people kinda obsess over Doctor...\nAnyway, I remastered this version of the song, and added a few other elements, and instrument balance, per a couple suggestions by Radiation Fox... So you can think of this as more of a Cosmic Surgen v. 0.1...",

The first five notes are from Chorale for Jaspers, and I used that twice in the song. I also used the chord progression that's often used in Sburban Jungle in the middle section with the drums, organ, piano and strings. (actually, a lot of homestuck songs) but the rest of it is original I'm pretty sure.\n(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf5X2PbLNfQ&lc=UgzZnx3ouFO3y5zD49B4AaABAg\">YouTube</a>)\n<blockquote>I thought I heard Black Hole/Green Sun, and also, if you squint your ears just right, it sounds a bit like The Dangerous Symphony (not a Homestuck song)</blockquote>\nBlack Rose/Green Sun is a great song. I did use the same sort of chord progression that's in there. It shows up in a lot of Homestuck songs though I think.",

Nonetheless, I think it turned out great. I had a battle between Hephaestus and Dave in mind as I wrote the piece, and took inspiration for it from the first few boss fights in the game Dark Souls.",

        "commentary": "<i>David Ellis:</i>\nWhen I started writing the pieces for the contest I knew I wanted one of them to be based around a theme that already existed. Running through a few ideas I landed on doing a kind of jazzy shuffle piece around the main theme from ‘The Beginning of Something Really Excellent’. As soon as I hit the first chord with the Rhodes piano it became smooth. The writing process was really quick and the piece was almost completely sketched out on the keyboard in one go. As the piece was intended for Jade - given the use of the earlier theme - I added in a little bass solo.\nTechnical note: Sometimes when I think I’ve finished writing something I’ll find that it’s a bit too long and something needs to change, this was one of those times. The sound you hear at 3:53 is the sound of me finding a way to avoid playing an extra intro/verse and tightening up the song a bit. Using almost the same build up heard earlier in the piece and changing the resolution at the end has the added advantage of (hopefully) making you think it’s heading back towards the intro riff until the key shifts in the last bar and the song jumps straight to the final chorus.",

        "commentary": "<i>David Ellis:</i>\nThis piece started as an offshoot of a song that was very loosely based on John and Jade’s three year voyage between the two windows. I felt that the theme that became the chorus to this piece needed to be at a higher tempo than the rest of that song so I took it out and based this tune around it instead. It was originally titled ‘Heir of the Dog’ as I was still thinking it could be either a Jade or a John piece at the time and wasn’t certain who I’d end up submitting it for (also because terrible puns).\nTechnical note: Although the piece features keyboard and guitar solos the bass was actually the hardest part to play, in particular during the chorus and the part behind the guitar solo.\nExtra: This is no longer true since I recorded <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGLUBAgOS7E\">the video</a>. For the original recording the two handed parts in the verses and the outro were originally done as 2 separate takes for each one. It wasn’t until I started the video that I thought ‘I could turn these into single parts’ and made things really difficult for myself.",

        "commentary": "<i>Ryan Ames:</i>\nI don’t want to clog up the audio post so I figured I’d make a separate post for my reasoning behind the different parts of the song!\nFirst off, the song itself was inspired by the mental image of Roxy jumping through fenestrated planes to get to a bunch of different places (hence the name Void Hopper). I tried capturing various aspects of her interests and personality through the different sections so it’s less of a Theme For Roxy than it is a Song About Roxy. There is still a particular melody that can be heard throughout all three major sections, so I suppose could be the MAIN THEME?\nANYWAY...... ==>\n<b>Section 1. [0:00-0:56]</b>\nThis section is meant to represent her childish and playful side. Roxy always seemed to have this child-at-heart quality about her, what with her infatuation with cutesy wizards and her bedroom in the beta session.\nThe beginning is an obvious nod to Harry Potter. She’s totally into wizards so I felt it was appropriate. It then turns into a waltz rendition of Jasper’s theme because she is also totally into cats. Then we have a neato transition that I guess could be her travelling through a window or something? I put a spacey sounding pad there to emphasize the VOIDINESS of it.\n<b>Section 2. [0:56-2:24]</b>\nAfter the transition, it picks up speed and has a variety of computer-y and sci-fi effects to hopefully capture her HACKER attribute. The bassline to Aggrievance can also be heard here as a callback to the STRIFE! between Mom and Rose. After that, we have the main theme again, this time accompanied by a busy slap bassline because I love slap bass. This and the following parts were an attempt to convey her get-shit-done attitude and her assertiveness with what she believes in. It could also be a cool action sequence. I imagine her rushing to reach a destination in time by jumping through windows and stuff all badass-like and it’s a pretty fitting mental image for her I think!\nAnyway, after this, it all ends with a booze snooze. The song slows down and gets kind of tipsy sounding before glitching out into white noise.\n<b>Section 3. [2:25-END]</b>\nRoxy is asleep and we are now on Derse. This last section is meant to represent her sleepwalking around the void. We have a little sad sounding ocarina melody which then makes way for the main theme to play one last time on violin. The song finally ends on an ominous and spooky note as Roxy drifts further and further into the void.\nWow I did not expect to type this much. Anyway this song was a blast to make and even if it’s not accepted, I still learned a whole lot! I hope you all enjoy listening to it as much as I enjoyed making it!",

The main idea I started out with was that I’d do a song with two parts, the first part representing Grandpa Harley, then I’d have it morph into the second part, which would be for post-scratch Jake. I first thought of having a literal record scratch but man that sounded dumb :] I referred to the first part, to myself, as Grandpa Harley, and the second part as Hellmurder Island.\nFor the Grandpa Harley part, I spent about half an hour listening to/watching ragtime piano and vaudeville acts on youtube, to refresh myself on the types of intervals and suchlike that they used. Then I just made it up.\nI wanted to make Hellmurder Island really dramatic. I had some (not particularly complicated) scenes of Jake running around on his island that I was making it a soundtrack for. Like…the first section is just…running around in the jungle. Then there’s him standing at the top of this huge waterfall, and some birds take off, and the last part is him fighting something or being about to enter the SBURB session. Whatever shit is about to get real for him. :3\nThe song is mainly influenced by ELO’s ‘Jungle’, haha. Mainly in the way it goes, “duh DUH, duh DUH!” I love how that sounds. I tried to do more jungley percussion but it didn’t end up sounding that good. I made the drum track in this app, which I pretty much use for all my drum tracks cuz it’s awesome.\nI did everything except the guitar - which was my bandmate playing - in Garageband using my midi keyboard and various soundfonts. I’m so in love with the one that does the main melody. It’s a flugelhorn. It just sounded so much like Jake to me!",

        "commentary": "<i>Max Wright:</i>\nDapper Dueling was inspired originally by a Steampunk band named The Cog is Dead - after listening to the song I just linked, I tried to take down the general feel and basic instrumentation, and then work on my own from there. Instruments used in the piece are:\n<ul><li>Acoustic Guitars</li> <li>Accordion</li> <li>Whistle Synth (fun fact, I’m pretty sure it’s the same one as used in Horchestra)</li> <li>Banjo</li> <li>Harmonica (1:14, panned left)</li> <li>Violin/Fiddle</li> <li>Full string section (1:28)</li> <li>Maracas, castanets, very very faint snare (you can hear it at 0:10, under the whistle), constant bass drum beat</li> <li>bang bang wink</li></ul>\nI also gave the original Showtime strife mix a few listens for the purpose of structuring my piece - after all, it’s meant to be a Strife theme. However, pretty much all sources of inspiration were only used in the parts before the banjo solo; the rest was just me having fun with music.\nLet me also point out that it made me extremely happy to see in canon that Jake bounces from side to side before he is about to fight; it was the exact image of him I was hoping for.\nAlso, while composing, I imagined Dapper Dueling to fit a fight scene similar to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGCMfprPJoA\">this</a>, from Sherlock Holmes (2009).\n(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/clnLNQkB5O4\">YouTube</a>)\nThis was my interpretation of a Jake Strife theme. After the intensity of [[Cobalt Corsair]] I wanted to make something fun to listen to, and ended up with this. Imagine Jake English bouncing nimbly from side to side, facing off to wrestle his eager opponent.",

        "commentary": "<i>Elaine Wang:</i>\nFun facts:\n“Dord” is a rather amusing typographical error that occured back in 1934 when someone in the Merriam-Webster editing staff misread “D or d”, intended as abbreviations for density, as “Dord” and... made up a pronunciation for it. (Whoops.)\nGiven Roxy Lalonde’s penchant for drunk typing^W^W lexicographical creativity, I thought it was appropriate. The accidentals, at least as much so. As for the waltz part of it... well, I have no idea either.\nIt was written as a Roxy song. It will now be a Roxy song until the end of the Internet.\nI came up with the title first and the music second. The accidentals were there the first time I put down the notes. (They are going to stay there.)\nThe above is not normal for me. I have more recently taken to using random word generators to title my music, because I often struggle with that.\nI am told that the song has some similarities to Endless Climb. That part is most definitely not deliberate. Not going to rule out subconscious influences though.\nThe album art is by merrigo. She (?) does cool work. Go look at her tumblr too.\n“Dord” is a real thing that happened in the Merriam-Webster in the 1934 edition. Read the article for more information.\nA dord is also a kind of instrument. There’s none of them in the song, just so’s you know.\nAlthough if you’re willing to play Dord on a dord I can send you sheet music.\nFull disclosure: I’m not actually finished with the Dord sheet music. Remind me in two weeks and I’ll probably have something.\nThe above two points also apply even if you aren’t going to play Dord on a dord. (I have no idea what the range of that instrument is, so whatever.)",

If you don’t know what happened, up until half-way through Act 4 a guy called Bill Bolin was on the time, one of the original members. He was a great musician, that much can’t be denied; he wrote a lot of tracks that appeared in early act 3; Jade’s bass solo, the remix of it, the last part of the Dave and Bro battle… some others I forget. During that flash with Dave and Rose on Derse the original music was five Bolin tracks, ones he wasn’t all that happy with. He flipped out and did a lot of things that ended up with him dropped from the team, and his music replaced.\nI called replacing Jade’s bass solo (I was enthusiastic about getting something of mine into the comic). We figured there’d probably be an existing piece of music used for the remix on Prospit so there were a couple of different versions remixing different tracks until Something Really Excellent was locked in.\nWe were on a strict timetable at the time, so I didn’t get the chance to find a really good bass voice or find a good rhythm. That was much improved for the actual release in Volumes 1-4.",

I then put together a larger mix of the tune with shinier production and a glockenspiel tag, and this was the version Andrew used in the end.\n<i>Buzinkai:</i>\nDoctor was written before Homestuck, actually. The only thing I can really remember was that Super Smash Bros Brawl came out right before I finished it. The original loop (which is not the one specifically heard in the comic, but was included in the album release) was directly inspired by music from Cave Story, and I was trying to at the time musically embody how I felt at the time, I think. Though it never seems to come out exactly as I plan it, I enjoyed the results. I will say that I cannot truly believe how many people have remixed it.\nThe arpeggio part at the end goes between the left, both, and right speakers sequentially. I was too lazy to set the channel settings manually, so I did each note on a different instrument, which is set to each speaker channel. Not many people know that, and I think it actually made it a living hell for remixers who got a hold of the original file.",

        "commentary": "<i>Solatrus:</i>\n<i>(original commentary)</i>\nHaha, oh man.\nMy vocal debut, and what is it? Me mocking the music kids shows. It’s an adorable song, though.\nOkay, so this one actually has a bit of history, quite a long time before Homestuck. I’ve been at this music thing for over 9 years after all.\nOriginally I was interested in writing a sort of uplifting and mellow hip hop song, and the first thing I did was make an organ synth with a swung version of one of the melodies you hear in Squiddles in Paradise. I was actually working with AndrewNeo (him again!) on the song.\nOf course, that never panned out, but when I finally felt like I should contribute to the Squiddles album (I was among the last to actually start something) all those years later, I remembered that melody.\nAnd then Alex told me the whole hip hop feel, even though it was pretty relaxing, just wasn’t gonna work. So I reworked it into a pretty cheesy and stereotypical reggae song and just stopped caring altogether about how it sounded. I mean, come on, it’s a freaking parody album!\nEventually Alex recorded some Squiddle vocals for it because I thought it’d be hilarious, and he sang (badly out of tune on purpose) the chorus. I thought it was brilliant and promptly wrote a full set of lyrics.\nTLDR, the chorus to Squiddles in Paradise was actually made up by Alex Rosetti basically on accident, and the song was originally some hip hop song I did over half a decade ago.\n<i>(commentary redux)</i>\nWell, what do you know, my vocal debut?\nThis song has a remarkably old history to it, elements of it dating back to 2005, not too long after I started using FL Studio. Originally this was a sort of uplifting hip-hop song that I did in collaboration with AndrewNeo, but the song was never finished. I’d share the song with you, but unfortunately I don’t have the plugins I used because back then I didn’t care as much about pirating VSTs and the like.\nAnyway, while this song is chronologically my second official Homestuck song, it’s also the second song I wrote after joining the team. The first song I wrote after joining will be discussed next time. Hehe.\nNonetheless, do have a little snippet of what I did with that hip-hop song when the Squiddles album was starting up, which is not too different from the original, aside from a more interesting beat and bassline. (<a href=\"http://www.solatrus.com/static/music/misc/Squiddlesofsomesort.mp3\">dead link</a>)\nI sent it over to Alex Rosetti, but we ended up agreeing that going with the hip-hop style. Even though it was a pretty relaxing song, it wasn’t going to be a good fit for what Alex had in mind for the album.\nThus, I scrapped it and started to work on other songs before coming back to it almost a month later.\nIt hit me one day that I should try rewriting the song in a really ridiculous, cheesy, and cliche reggae style, and completely not care. So I did.\nI again sent this to Alex and he really liked it, and he quickly recorded some Squiddles very horribly singing what eventually became the chorus. I thought it was brilliant and was immediately inspired to write lyrics for the entire song, which really helped flesh out everything. It also let me use Radiation’s hilarious Skipper Plumbthroat voice briefly, though that went uncredited in the song, hah!\nAnd after some work, I arrived to the final song that’s on the Squiddles album.\n<b>Other Thoughts</b>\nMichael Bowman once mentioned that Squiddles in Paradise is one of the few songs on the album that really balances the act between a legitimate song and a downright silly song. I was pretty flattered when both said this and when he recommended this song, among others from the album, to a fan.\nI actually have to agree with Bowman after looking back at it almost two years later. Despite how little effort I feel that I put into this song, it was a really fun and silly song to write… about kid-friendly horrorterrors… in paradise.",

If you want hard-rocking, excellently mastered, brainkilling tracks, look no further than Tensei's [[album:Strife!]] album. It should wet your whistle for heavy metal, and possibly any other multitude of wind instruments you present to its sweaty, testosterone-laden spray.\nInstead.\nThis album is for a special group of people. The people that open the AlterniaBound flashes in one tab and then leave them on repeat, just so they can listen to Horschestra 4000 times. These are the people that complained incessantly when Eridan's theme wasn't on an album, even though it hadn't even existed in the comic yet. Some of these people have named their children after MSPA characters.\nYou terrible, wonderful people. This album is your fault.\nNow go forth and enjoy: Not in MP3, but in WAV; not in OGG, but in FLAC. The nostalgia-rich AlterniaBound tracks you all sought so dearly have been padded out by new experiences, forged from feverish hearths by several of our greatest musical madmen in order to breathe new life into a setlist you saw long coming. The bonus tracks have been tweaked, the equalizers have been set, and the fans, the fans are stoked like the blazes these beats were born hence. Hopefully you will find the tracks carved out from these sick fires to be... sufficiently ill.\nNow! Let it begin, young ones. Just keep in mind:\nOnce you pop, the games don't stop.\nOh, and the games.\nWILL THEY EVER?\n<i>Quasar Nebula:</i>\nas with [[album:homestuck-vol-5]], track art for [[album:alternia]] and [[album:alterniabound]] is from the <a href=\"https://alterniaart.tumblr.com/\">Alternia/Bound</a> track art anthology projects! original track arts, which were largely (though not entirely) just crops of panels from the webcomic, have been left in the commentary for each track.",

This song is also supposed to kinda chronicle her change from robot to god tier, which is reflected in the Vocaloid voice becoming gradually less robotic, and the introduction of more and more acoustic instruments as the song goes on, while the synthesizers take a backseat.\nRadiation noted that the start of the song somewhat resembles the song \"Fly Away Now\" from the anime Panty &amp; Stocking with Garterbelt, which, for once, wasn't intentional, but is still quite appropriate, as both songs describe a transformation sequence.\nStylistically this song is really all over the place; I drew inspiration from Eurobeat, Dance, Shibuya-kei, Disco, Acid Jazz and even chiptunes, but I tried to all mold it into a distinct personal style of electronic music, rather than basing it on a single artist or song.\nThe voice sample is from the Dr. Who episode \"Blink\".\nCoincidentally, the album version of this song is actually a version that was remastered at a lower volume level to fit in better with the album. The original versions (i.e. the versions that I mastered myself) of \"Arisen Anew\" and \"She's a Sp8der\" will be available for free in 192 kbps mp3 format on my tindeck account.\n<i>Toby Fox:</i>\nSo why start with this track? Tensei's album was last, so starting with another solid track by him starts us off with a good impression and holds the listener up from where they were. It's almost like an unofficial continuation of his album's narrative this way... sorta like musical fanfiction, I guess.\nThat, and the whole song kinda reminds me of an anime opening where Aradia undergoes a 3 minute transformation into a maid costume.

Initially this song was simply so, but after I learned more about the scope and depth of the AlterniaBound project... I decided that more of a change was in order for the track. (It was at that point that I also decided it would be cool to have some hidden tracks... leading to the early premiere of many tracks that would eventually be on [[album:homestuck-vol-6]].\nA little while ago, I finished the \"final version\" of this track. It's not incredibly melodic or wrenchingly dire like my usual fare, but it still remains one of my own personal favorites:\n<ul><li>It's pompous, alien, and goofy - in short, pretty accurate of Karkat and Alternia as a whole</li><li>It subtly implies that tuba is Karkat's instrument of choice, which we all know is entirely true</li><li>WHO THE FUCK LET THE ELEPHANTS IN HERE ARRRGH FUCKING GAMZEE</li></ul>\nI hope you like it too.

It didn't feel right to repeat a single part of it indefinitely, so I instead took several motifs from it and re-implemented them into a new track. It has a similar chord progression, and in ways of instrumentation it has the harpsichord as the main instrument, oboe, deep piano, triangle, and the \"tick tock tick tock\" woodblocks that are the eternal harbringer of her countdown judgment.\nAfter I first completed the song, I noticed that the track was kind of short. That's when I came up with the idea for the second part of the piece - a reprise of \"Theme\" from the Alternia album. This shows that Terezi has another side to her beyond her devious Alternian judgment: She truly cares about her friends, so much that she has a certain level of tender emotion that almost puts Karkat to shame. I'm not sure if the bifurcation of the piece worked really well as a faux videogame track, but I think it fits her personality.\n<i>Homestuck:</i>\n(<i>original track art</i>)\n<img src=\"media/misc/terezis-theme.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\">",

Originally, I tried a mix of various brass instruments, percussion, string orchestra, koto, and an electric bass. It didn't feel right. So I pushed that piece aside altogether and restarted with an instrumentation more reminiscent of that used in \"Cuddlefish,\" the troll theme I made for Feferi right before I joined the music team. The intro piano was meant to feel spacey, reminiscent of [[Eldritch]] and [[English]], sort of bringing the listener into the afterlife. When the flute enters, I feel that this was as Feferi communicated with the Elder Gods of setting up her dream bubble. The orchestral crescendo brings us to the area deep in space where the bubbles float. From then on, we travel past several bubbles, just absorbing the scenery. The rest of the piece contains glimpses of other events within the bubbles, such as Feferi and Jade's dream chats and the shocking developments concerning the troll session's guardian code. And, of course, a major key ending for all the happy folks floating around in the afterlife.\n<i>Toby Fox:</i>\nThomas is continually on point with his orchestral stuff.

I cobbled together a collection of unrelated soundsets and generated a jazzy, laid-back version - which, despite its tempo, still sounds kind of jarring and discontent due to the clashing of textures between instruments.\nThe tune's upbeat enough that you can't stand up to it. It will kick you down. It's pretty strong for how dinky and messy it is! It's also the kind of piece that could be kind of pretty if its voice wasn't cracking every three seconds. Chances are you'll either enjoy or find aspects of it extremely annoying... but that's kinda the way she is.\nLike Terezi's theme, the piece's second part contains another reprise of \"Theme\" in the piano - but to contrast the other Scourge sister, Vriska's version of \"Theme\" is hopeless and dark. Where Terezi showed hope and emotion, Vriska only shows fear, anger, and loathing due to the repression of her own emotions, her upbringing, and her rotten attitude. In the flash, the high and low of the theme repeat indefinitely... on the album, the piece ends, but on an unresolved chord.\nWho knows what's up next for her?\n... oh, and if you're looking for the full verison of Spider's Claw, wait until Volume 8, ok????????\n<i>Homestuck:</i>\n(<i>original track art</i>)\n<img src=\"media/misc/vriskas-theme.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\">",

I do a lot of really short tunes for Homestuck that are often more silly than epic-sounding. And this is another one! More specifically, this is a remix of Radiation's \"dESPERADO ROCKET CHAIRS\" in the style of a Pokem-- er, Fiduspawn battle.\nAs a handful of you on the forums may know, I've always been a bit of a Pokemon fan. Other songs included in Alternia have focused more on SGRUB or Flarping, but I've wanted to do a Fiduspawn song for a while now. This song kind of acts as an homage to both Tavros and the old Pokemon games. I tried to invoke the style of the battles in the classic Game Bro Boy versions when creating this song.\nListen closely and you can hear snippets of other Homestuck pieces! I absolutely love doing this. (Most of my other songs feature the opening notes of Vagabounce somewhere. <a href=\"artist/david-ko/\">Ooh, go find them!</a> It's like a treasure hunt!)\n<i>Toby Fox:</i>\nThis track was awesome to work on. David's songs are always really darn fun, and while fiddling around with it I was barely cognizant of the irony that I was arranging someone else's remix of my own track.

I originally wrote it as the theme just for walking around her house, but I think it turned out to fit her really well as a character despite my own doubts.\nLike Terezi's theme, \"Darling Kanaya\" isn't a remix of her Alternia track ([[Virgin Orb]]), but it contains some similar stuff. There are heavily vibrato'd strings... wavering, luscious 7th chords... melodic piano... lots of arpeggios... and a general uplifting feeling of satisfying, calm emotion. She is one of the very few characters in Hivebent that I would categorize as \"sane\" by human standards, and thus actually one of my favorite trolls. And despite the semi-low quality of the instrumentation, this is one of my favorite tracks by myself.\nIt's all kind of ghostly and heartfelt, like a sad look out the window with a romance novel in your lap, and then a knowing, welcoming smile. I think that makes sense considering she's an undead vampire now! Or not.\n<i>Homestuck:</i>\n(<i>original track art</i>)\n<img src=\"media/misc/darling-kanaya.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\">",

Somehow a bit of Infected Mushrooms influence got mixed into it as it became more synthesized and trancey.\nThe chiptune segment at the end is basically a nod straight to the original Castlevania games; I wanted to make the Castlevania influence obvious.\nAll the song titles from the SotN soundtrack have appropriately gloomy and foreboding names like \"Moonlight Nocturne\", \"Requiuem for the Gods\", \"Land of Benediction\" and \"Death Ballad\". Kanaya is basically the Alternian equivalent of a goth, and I've always found it hilarious how goths and vampire-fans on her world are all about sunshine and rainbows, so I thought it would be funny to incorporate that weird dichotomy into the title.\n<i>Toby Fox:</i>\nI like the idea of having two diametrically opposed Kanaya tracks one right after the other.

MANY months later I discovered the Ultimate Megadrive soundfont by The_Eighth_Bit and I decided to remake it as a boss theme for Eridan. Basically everything about the song changed - the only thing that remains is the main melody and chords.\nIt's not a really overwhelming track because Eridan is a bit of a joke, but I'm pretty happy with it. The bassline and solo section are some of the sassiest I've ever written, the melody is still really catchy, and the action is persistent. Just listen to that thing a couple times and I'll be damned if it doesn't get stuck in your head.\n*I have since done something better called [[Earthsea Borealis]].

As it loops, however, a dark droning backdrop becomes gradually more apparent, a darkness beneath the playfulness implied by the first part. The calliope fades out until only the droning sound remains, showing in essence that playtime is over. Also, I figured nothing makes carnival music sound more twisted than for the tempo/pitch to change, so I had the whole thing start gradually slowing down over time, giving it an even more unnatural feel. I wanted one last build-up near the end to build tension, and as it fades out and the listener is just starting to relax... HONK. honk.\nOn a side note, I think I enjoy writing creepy music even more than any other kind of music.\n<i>Toby Fox:</i>\nSoundtrack-wise...

        "commentary": "<i>Malcolm Brown:</i>\n(Final Battle Against the Black King)\nOr \"King of the Twelve Angels\" in Google Translator Latin.\nThis was designed as music for the EPIC yet only hinted at battle between the Black King and the Trolls at the end of their game. Rather than making it a fast-paced action-centric doom-fest, it ended upmore like some kind of apocalyptic dance number: The Trolls, despite going against fairly tough odds, all banded together under Karkat's leadership into a well oiled, tactical nuclear force that managed to overcome the Black King and beat the game.\nIt is, along with the unique 'Black King's theme, more or less a combination of various Troll themes arranged in order of attack. It's probably easier to just explain what's going on where:\n0:00 - We start with the black king's introduction, Aradiabots from doomed timelines teleporting in and assembling, the reckoning beginning, the Vast Glub being suppressed.\n1:34 - At this point, the fearless leader steps into action as the first to attack ([[Crustacean]]). I like to think this move shreds any sense of doubt they had in Karkat as leader at this point. Karkat's theme's quite fun to work with, so I enjoyed this bit.\n2:03 - Terezi made sense as a logical follow to Karkat ([[The Lemonsnout Turnabout]]). It starts off quite simple yet more organised than Karkat's section, representing Terezi's initial appearance as a fairly harmless, blind Troll girl, before building up to her surprise attack. I'd already mucked about with Terezi's theme in my other track, but this one I think is a bit more faithful to the original.\n2:34 - The King responds.\n2:56 - Tavros in his Jet Car ([[dESPERADO ROCKET CHAIRS,]]). There's a hint of tragedy to Tavros' character that I think comes through here - His melody kinda builds up but just as he's about to act it kinda fades back down. Ah well... The world's smallest violin is playing the intro trumpet section to Tavros' original theme here.\n3:15 - Kanaya, being quite graceful and yet incredibly deadly ([[Virgin Orb]]). She pretty much stops the music and focuses all attention on her - Something she'll do again in the future. I really like the opening of Kanaya's theme, so this is one of my fave bits. The chainsaw is also quite a fun touch.\n3:34 - Equius decides to step in and show people how it's done with the might and efficiency only a highb100d could bring, and indeed he probably would, but Nepeta keeps being silly and sneaking in some attacks ([[Horschestra]] &amp; [[Walls Covered in Blood]]). It was a bit of a faff combining these two, but I liked the idea of Equius' almost military like anthem being interrupted by Nepeta's calypso funkiness.\n3:53 - Feferi and Eridan move in ([[Keepers]]). These two have worked together before, and provide a potent force against the King.\n4:13 - The King responds once again.\n4:36 - Sollux and Aradia decide to now get involved having kept the King's psychic powers in check ([[The La2t Frontiier]] &amp; [[psych0ruins]]). I took more or less the openings of both themes and tried gluing them together. There's also an additional bit influenced by Aradia's in the 2nd half.\n4:56 - Based on Karkat's description on what Gamzee's contribution to the fight was, I figured having Gamzee 'parody' the King's theme worked better here. The music doesn't even really imply what his attack was, only that it built up, was unleashed, and surprised the hell out of everyone...\n5:14 - The King's nearly defeated and getting desperate.\n5:39 - Vriska steps up, and finishes it. With one impossi8ly lucky roll.\n<i>Toby Fox:</i>\nI'm incredibly flattered to have such an awesome track feature so many pieces of music by myself... another miracle from the guy who brought you Showtime, folks.\nDefinitely the peak of intensity on the album.\n<i>Homestuck:</i>\n(<i>original track art</i>)\n<img src=\"media/misc/rex-duodecim-angelus.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\">",

Most of them do a great job of contributing to the idea of a videogame based on Homestuck, though - so please use your imagination when you queue them up, and wish really hard!\nI used Mega Man X2 samples (by daveeeey) for this track. If Nepeta had a level in a Mega Man X game, this is probably something like what it would sound like... it's just a little bit like Neon Tiger, but maybe just in the chords. They both have the same claw weapons. Neon Tiger probably pounces because he likes Mega Man X. Time to update my shipping wall!!!\nI really think the toms in the opening do a good job of setting a \"jungle\" feel to the track. Same with the roaring cymbals and the jumpy bassline. The orchestra hits have a bunch of cool effects on them, too - vibrato, echo, pan, pitch shift... all within the limitations of something a SNES could do! Although I probably went over the instrument limitations for the system, especially if sound effects are involved...\nOh!

It starts out with some mystical, deep-sea vibraphones, rolling cymbals like waves washing through the piece... then plays some more beach-like music, which has just a hint of brassy regality to it. The solo is a bit emotional, kinda back and forth between happy and tempestuous, but that's how it is between moirails.\nEridan is DEFINITELY the boss of this level.\nShame that Fef doesn't get a really Feffy track to herself on this album. Poor Fef. BUT if you ARE looking for that and don't mind skipping over somewhere else, go back to the Squiddles Album and check out [[Carefree Princess Berryboo]] by Alex Rosetti. I think it fits her perfectly, especially as far as AlterniaBound walkabout themes go... enjoy it, it's cute!\nI sadly don't remember who suggested the name \"Science Seahorse\"... someone cool.

Track art is the property of the credited visual artists.\nThe Ancestral Album and related media are brought to you by Josefin B and the Ancestral Music Team, and are unofficial fan works based on Andrew Hussie's <i>Homestuck</i>. <i>Homestuck</i> is a property of Andrew Hussie and What Pumpkin.\n<i>Josefin B.:</i>\n<b>Special Thanks</b>\nI would like to thank Blackhole for having helped and guided me through this entire process. Couldn't have done it otherwise. Circlejourney for assembling the booklet and thus ensuring there would be one. Everyone who jumped in at a second's notice when I needed a track done. Everyone at the LoFaM team for having helped me and for managing a lot if not all the final workload. It's been fun.\n<i>Rangzhe:</i>\nAs it is the cover of the album, I wanted to make it dramatic as much as to my ability. I wanted to put them in order of the zodiac at first but I realized that it didn't look as great, so I put the Signless and his associates as one and the other highbloods on the other side, and to show the Handmaid vs Condesce I made them top and bottom, as polar opposites. I felt like this was the best way to put them to show their interactions in the stories. The background was inspired by the actaul Homestuck album \"Alternia\" and the pixel-y title font is also because of the ancestor's role to prepare the descendants for the game.\n<i>Josefin B.:</i>\nTo some extent, I consider Ancestral to be a little sister album to [[album:Beforus]]. We share many contributors and this project was largely inspired by Beforus. The reason we asked Rangzhe to make our cover was to tie it in. The very last track of Beforus, [[Motions of Infinity]], ending with the ancestors being created, was drawn by her. Isn't it fitting how she begins this story after having ended the last? That, and her art is hella.",

Though there's not much canon information on him, towards the end I was able to include an excerpt from <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/3758\">Page 3758</a>, in which Midnfang journals about the Summoner. I also looked to [[Bronze Rebel]] from coloUrs and mayhem and [[♉ - Breathtak1ng]] from the Beforus Album to get a feel on what instruments I should be using. I gave the song a bit more of a minor key since the Summoner's life most likely wasn't the easiest or most fun life to lead. This track was definitely great fun to work on, and I'm definitely honoured to be a part of the Ancestral Album!\n<i>Molly:</i>\nI quite like how this piece came out! The track itself was lovely and soothing, and the vocals at the end added an interesting feeling to it, almost like a story book. I wanted to showcase the atmosphere rather than The Summoner directly, but still wanted it to be obvious that this is The Summoner's track, and a view point from behind where you can obviously see his defining caharacteristics but not directly see his face felt like the best way to accomplish that! That, and a purple and blue night sky above the rust-blooded Summoner, with a golden fire in front of him feels rather poetic ina way. This was definitely a learning experience, and a really fun piece to work on for the album. I'm excited to see what's next!",

He spreads the message of such a world knowing it will fall on mostly deaf ears, even met with hostility.

        "commentary": "<i>Seren Mist:</i>\nWhen I was assigned to write Redglare's main track for the album, my first thought was to make it a very orchestral track, with lots of strings. As it was forming, I decided that limiting myself to only orchestral instruments would hamper my exploration of her character, so I added in more synth sounds and heavier drums. The name of the track comes from a play on \"His Honorable Tyrrany\" and from a quote by Alexander Pope, \"On wrongs swift vengeance waits.\" I think it's quite fitting for Redglare, who blindsides Mindfang but in the name of justice, of course.\n<i>Liz Fish:</i>\nThis track inspired me to put a noir twist on my usual style. I could picture Redglare stalking down dirty back alleys and seedy underground establishments, hunting down the fleeing criminals that need to be brought to JUST1C3 in a gritty detective game with cyberpunk flavor. A great track and a great character; I hope I've done justice for them both. >:]",

The original title of the track was \"Robot Pirate Island\" and had a shift into a ravecore EDM as opposed to the constant high energy baroque sound we have here. This current edit is from april of 2016. I would create another, had it not been for the project crashing upon loading. It sounds incredibly rough in comparison to my current skill and I'm losing a little sleep over it. A damn shame since the amount of tools and knowledge I have now could make this sound night and day in quality, but what you hear is what you get.\n<i>Sigourney Martin:</i>\nWhile working on this piece, the song wasn't difficult per-say? It was more challenging, because I had many different images on how I wanted this to look like. In the end, I chose what I drew and it was fun! I tried watercolours (though it might not be noticable) and I think it turned out alright!",

I drew him in a situation where he is getting ready to take care of his usual business: culling some trolls. The song sounded powerful so I wanted to try and portray the GHB that way too by drawing him much larger than the trolls in the foreground. There are some silhouettes of other trolls in the background which are the other subjuggulators. I added some of my own headcanons for what I like to imagine he dresses like and kept it relatively simple, as well as trying to add as much color to the image as I could. He's also looking outwards and the viewpoint is that of someone in the crowd of trolls that are about to be culled, so it can be taken as a \"you're next\" type scenario. Truly I just tried to create a piece that represented what the music made me envision and feel, and I hope I could do the lovely song some justice!",

I was originally going to add lyrics and make a shanty, but the instrumental alone sounded perfect. Dualscar is always portrayed loud and angry so I quieted the mood.\n<i>Cro:</i>\nThis piece was really intersting to try out. I was experimenting with a way of painting over everything rather than just staying within the comfort zone of line art. I think for the most part it worked out. Considering the song literally had wave sounds in it, I'd figure to put Dualscar near an ocean as well. The song parallels Eridan's theme too, so I thought I'd set a callback to when he took down a whale of his own. Dualscar's a messy shot thoug, which is why he's probably cleaning the spill off his gun.",

My main inspiration for the Disciple's New Beginning was Requited, since it's a song about the love between The Disciple and The Signless. Since The Disciple's New Extreme is about The Disciple meeting and falling in love with Signless, Requited was my go-to music fuel.\n<i>Gilwing:</i>\nRequited is a very special song to me, so I'm very thankful I got to do the art for this track.

You may recognize bits from [[Jade Mother]], [[Iron Infidel]], [[Gold Pilot]], [[Requited]] from Homestuck Vol. 8 and something like [[Nepeta's Theme]] from AlterniaBound. The narrative of the song follows the Dolorosa, Signless, Disciple, and Psiioniic as they get together and meet each other.\nThis is by far the most complicated track I've ever composed and I'm pretty proud of it. There are about seven instruments and over ten parts. I hope you enjoy!\n<i>Erin B.:</i>\nThere's so much to this \"family's\" story and so much from the song that I really love.

It has this really deliberate vibe, but it's so forlorn in its conclusion. After reading the composer's commentary I really wanted to capture that feeling of Darkleer both walking to and away from his duty, so I thought the marching boots would be a nice visual metaphor for that.

The lyrics are a combination of things the Signless is thinking to himself and \"saying\" to the people around him, in particular Darkleer. I wanted to create a sense of urgency, and the feeling that while the Signless is saying over and over that he doesn't care if he dies, he may be lying. Musically, I wanted to portray a since of racing thoughts, which means there isn't really a conventional song structure. The vocals are echoey for <i>~aesthetic~</i>. Enjoy!\n<i>Oskarna:</i>\nThis song marks the end of the Signless' life, encapsulating what would have been his last thoughts and words.

The very title of this track is also lifted from the original submission. Though it was in a roundabout way, I'm glad I got to contribute to the album with a brand new piece!\nThis particular song features a lot of piano, owing to its predecessor's status as a solo piano composition. However, I thought some mournful strings would also represent the idea of Darkleer's exile well, and their slow, dark nature under the main piano melody expresses the shame and confusion he must have felt the entire time. It's hard being a highblood and expressing a sudden act of kindness that gets you ostracized from every upper caste, wrecks your social standing and upends your entire way of life. It's hard and nobody understands.\n<i>Xagave:</i>\nThis made me think of Darkleer's life in general so here he is, standing proud and doing his job, and then his slouched form bemoaning his existence after being banished.",

Musical inspiration for the song came largely from PhemieC's fansongs and [[Olive Scribe]] (from coloUrs and mayhem: Universe A). Composing it was a journey in itself; along the way she taught me a lot about her history, her undying dedication, and storytelling. She had so much to say, it was difficult to limit myself to such a concise song.

I'd imagine that gaining unwanted immortality from the Condesce would eventually cause his job to lose the dramatics and emotions over a period of decades or maybe even centuries.\n<i>gelasticat:</i>\nI based the composition of the picture on the adjacent notes on the opposite ears with the two most prominent figures in the Psiioniic's life.

Not because of the technical difficulty but because of the subject matter: Dolorosa is a tragic figure and her sad fate was entirely undeserved.\nThis song opens shortly after the passing of the signless; the four chimes signal his loss and the sad flute her grief. This continues into the arrival of Marquise Spinneret Mindfang: someone Dolorosa may have initially hoped would provide a safer refuge but Mindfang had her own plans for the political prisoner. While the potential for a red relationship between the two was hinted at, it certainly began with empathetic possession which is explored in the second movement of the song: Dolorosa struggles but eventually falls under Mindfang's spell. Darker sounds speak of that despair and when Mindfang finally lets her be, she feels more alone and empty than ever, wishing for someone to come and set her free. Unfortunately, she gets her wish - at the hands of Orphaner Dualscar who frees her of her very existence, solely to spite his soon-to-be former kismesis. The six bell chiems as she passes away echo the beginning of the song and the end of her son.\nLike many of my songs, it is in 6/8 time: Maryams being the sixth troll on the hemospectrum, Serkets the eighth while the snare drum at the end makes eleven hits to represent Ampora. It's a \"dark mirror\" to [[Dear Heart]] but follows the sad canon story told by Mindfang's journal. I hope you found I did this unfortunate chapter of the Ancestors' story justice.\n<i>Oskarna:</i>\nThe death of the Signless marks the beginning of a very different chapter of the Dolorosa's story, and this song does a wonderful job setting the tone for it. I wanted to focus on her initial emptiness - the instigator of this chapter of the Ancestral tale.",

The piece begins with a driving electric guitar riff representing Mindfang as she sets out on the oceans to meet her foe. Mindfang's motif is interrupted by Redglare's harpsichord as she approaches. As the two clash, both instruments and motifs do battle, fighting to gain the upper hand in the arrangement.\n<i>Lilly Higgs:</i>\nThis track is so full of energy!! I wanted to convey that with a dynamic, confrontational (haha) composition set at an angle. Given Mindfang and Redglare's uh, charged relationship and energy, I wanted them to be close, with hot, palpable tension that doesn't ever really get fulfilled. Redglare's about to wallop Mindfang a good one at the same time as she's about to reach her glowing dice, all wrapped in the burning embers of her fleet. If you look closely, you can see the Sufferer's sign swinging around Redglare's neck like a noose.",

Unlike many Homestuck songs, this one isn't particularly electronic-sounding, and I think it feels almost like a woe-is-me song from a musical. Hope you enjoy!\n<i>Amanda Bell:</i>\nFor this piece I wanted to amplify the melancholy and regret that Darkleer feels after he lets the Disciple go after the Sufferer's execution.

Which is a shame, because the piece of track art I saw (this one, in fact) was very good! So, I spent the next week or so making a song in the style of a certain French nu disco duo (no prizes for guessing who) out of elements from [[Rust Servant]] and [[Fuchsia Ruler]], a subtle nod to [[Eternity Served Cold]], and an even subtler nod to WMM's unofficial remake of Rust Servant, [[Rust Apocalypse]]. For how quickly I made this track, I think it turned out rather well!\n<i>Elanor Pam:</i>\nThe battle between the Condesce and the Handmaid is still one of the most mysterious parts of the story, and I feel its impact and consequences have yet to be fully explored. There's no question that it was an insidious trap for the Condesce, but what is the true nature of the curse spoken by Doc Scratch...?",

Chucklevoodoos always feels like some kind of signature sign with the Makara line. Not only that, but it leaves a sense of unease. Overall, the song gave an ominous feel to me where surrounding the Grand High Blood in an atmosphere was not only complimenting, but fitting! Also, bood on the walls for that extra touch. It's safe to say that the picture pays homage to his appearance in the comic, with the stylizing and unique attributes of course!\nGetting that glow was my prime focus, and to also light up and put some focus at that wicked paint of his! They have to be some of the physical characteristics that stand out the most to me, and certainly focal points that I attempted to pull attention towards.",

        "commentary": "<i>Malcolm Brown:</i>\nSo it's the music forum discussion, and there's talk about albums representing each of the kids and discussions on what the styles would be. Some are obvious (like say, Dave) and some are offering a bit more discussion. It comes to Rose and there's a degree of uncertainty, and I suggest that it'd be veering into classical, offering up Saint-Saëns \"Dance Macabre\" as an example of the sort of thing I'd expect, and then set out to whip something up.\nAnd at this point in the story Rose's set on flying her dream self with the tumor into the green sun to destroy it (Ah remember those days). In a tried and true effort of \"trying to predict where Hussie will take the story and make music for it\" BR/GS was scribed as a \"very sad, yet hopeful, song about Rose's eventual sacrifice\" - Hence why it all builds up to a big creshendo and then fades away (and why it's called Black Rose / Green Sun , although there's another reason for that as explained below)\nThe whole thing is based on yet another piece I made years ago and drafted it out of retirement and made it into something new and useful. The music box was one of the key elements, representing a kind of creepy childlike innocence, and then Rose's signature instrument (the violin, although the sample used is actually a viola and the notes it plays are closer to a cello) begins to kind of build up. Eventually we see the majesty of the green sun, and the rest of the song builds up to the tumors destruction. (All of which never happened even remotely in this way but that's what the song was supposed to be about anyway). The overall style is a kind of very sinister attempt at representing something small vs something huge - Original inspiration was taken from the style of music from Xenogears (Yasunori Mitsuda, being very celtic and awesome).\nThe scratchy-sfx were my attempt at auralising the green sun's \"scratch\" effect. I'm not 100% convinced they work but Andrew kept 'em in so whatever.\nWhen Andrew asked to use it, it was going to be for a walkaround, so I needed to make some adjustments to make it loopable for the flash. For the album, I added a second section with a keytar solo (I was mucking about with it at the time) to make it a bit more interesting. Ultimatly it ended up being used for something completely different than originally intended, and oddly the name (\"Black Rose\") became oddly apt once she went all grimdark and tried to fight Jack (\"Green Sun\").\nThe name was also a reference to a Sonata Arctica song, similarly titled involving colours, except it was called \"White Pearl, Black Oceans\".",

        "commentary": "<i>Malcolm Brown:</i>\nThe name comes from a line of Rose's during Act 5 while discussing her options of survival with Doc Scratch:\n<code style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: But it's a little disheartening to learn I'm now faced with not one, but two suicide missions at once.</code>\n<code style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: One to destroy Jack's power source and defend all of existence, and another to ensure our cosmic progeny at the price of oblivion.</code>\nAs soon (like, not a minute after) as I saw Rose go grimdark, I decided to wrote some hilariously ANGRY AND KICKASS BATTLE MUSIC for her (presumed inevitable) battle with Jack. The original sort of concept was something like the music of Guilty Gear - All guitars and organs and the like. It took several attempts to try and tone it into something useful, but in the end I decided to dig up Chorale for Jaspers - A previous bit of music used for representing the death of Rose's cat (The main themes here being the death of Rose's mother and the anger she feels afterwords).\nSo that's where we start, with a kind of messed up, creepy violin rendition of Chorale for Jaspers, before we start to build up and then kick into the main part of the song. Around 1:00 we here the music box chords from Black Rose/ return, then at 1:20 it's another Keytar Solo from me (I'd just bought it and was feeling cocky). The rhythm guitar and guitar solo at the end was also me and also something I was terrified to do since I don't normally do \"Live\" playing (Everything is usually sequenced). In this case, a lot of it was so difficult to do (Because I can barely play guitar. At all) at this speed most of it was played at a slower tempo and then sped up digitally (HAX!).\nThe drums were easily the funnest thing to sequence in this thing, mainly all the awesome fills and the double bass step at the end. The final guitar solo is an attempt to reference Rose's original \"Strife\" theme - Aggrieve. It's very loosely there, and I reckon needs to come back in some fashion since it's actually kind of awesome.\nWhen Andrew told me he was going to use this one for a fight scene I was looking heavily forward to it. Imagine my surprise when just as it's about to kick off... John gets himself stabbed.",

The scene inspiring it was obviously Terezi's ancestor Redglare vs Vriska's ancestor Mindfang during the sort of mock-trial that ended in Mindfang mind-controlling the crowd and hanging Redglare. Felt like a nice scene to try some musical accompaniment, so I did.\nSo a combination of liking Terezi's theme and getting my hands on some new samples and voices, I decided to whip this together. The idea was a very tribal, savage kind of military march (and chanting) to represent the lower class masses baying for blood. It starts off using Lemonsnout Turnabout for Terezi, but then quickly changes to Crystalanthemums -- Specifically for the reference to \"Make Her Pay\" and Crystamanthequins as a kind of \"Vriska vs Somebody\" theme. Ideally it would've just evolved into Vriska's theme, but I find that one a bit tricky to work with.\nFinally it throws in a string glissando as tension mounts, and then snap! Dead! (The snapping is some kind of double bass string snap.)\nThe little eerie female vocalist thing didn't really work and is a bit cliched, but I kinda like the rest of the track. Always nice to give character deaths a little celebration\nThe name's fairly obvious - I was trying to work in some kind of \"Trial and Error\" gag but I guess this works.",

        "commentary": "<i>Tensei:</i>\nAlright, as requested, I’ll do some indepth commentary on already released Homestuck songs, starting off with Spider8reath.\nNow, you may have heard this from me before, but Vriska is HANDS DOWN the most fun character to write music for. It’s hard to exactly pinpoint the reason for this, but something about her character just invites badass pentatonic blues riffs, squealing guitars and shrill horns all over the place.\nReally, when you pick it apart, this song is actually very simple at its basis, containing a pretty typical blues progression, and the constantly repeated guitar/bass riff which is introduced right at the start and then just keeps on going ( dadada DA dada DA dada dada dadadada, it’s really fun to sing along actually!)\nThe horn section actually adds the bulk of the songs ‘gravy’, providing lots of switch-ups, sometimes playing in unison with the main riff, sometimes splitting up and providing countermelodies or underlining the harmonized guitars. It was also by far the hardest part to write because I had literally no previous experience with brass writing, but I got some great feedback from other music team members.\nActually part of the reason that it was so hard to implement is probably because the song was already more or less ‘done’ before I thought of putting in a few brass stabs here and there. Then as I was writing the brass became more and more of a foreground element, and that’s how Spider8reath became the screamy shrill funfest that it is now.\nPeople who said that the exposed guitar solo at the start reminded them of Van Halen were totally right, because the song ‘Eruption’ was more or less a direct inspiration for it. I think it turned out really well, and it serves as a great intro to the song!\nReally though, the main inspiration for this song simply comes from building on the previous Vriska songs that Radiation did. While the brass was a new, spur-of-the-moment addition, the guitar riffs and melodies were always supposed to be reminiscent of stuff like Spider’s Claw, Killed by Br8k Spider and MeGaLoVaNia. People definitely seem to associate this song with Vriska too now, so mission accomplished I guess?",

Around about 0:56 I wanted to try some cool chord progression as a kind of extension of John's theme (Something I've used in future i.e. Do You Remem8er Me).

Also, yes, that is why there is distorted owl screeches at the end, although they were more meant to evoke the horrorterrors crying out in pain than owls by the time it was finished.\nContains some very powerful organ and some great chord progressions, but also some structural choices I am not completely proud of, which remained in the piece until its release months and months later because the original Finale file crashed on me before I had a chance to save it.  So, rather than attempt reconstructing it, I went with what I had, and it stuck.",

        "commentary": "<i>Malcolm Brown:</i>\nOk, so this one. First main goal was some kind of Doctor remix, on the ground that I never actually did one (Took my hiatus around the time of Vol 5.) so this was partially a jokey attempt to \"Join in the fun\". Secondary goal was mainly a combination of liking the track this is mostly based on (Waking World) and the concept of Godhood ascension (Didn't have a particular character in mind at the time). There's also a little bit of wanting to try some new instrument samples (Namely choir and guitar) so there was a bit of experimentation in this one too.\nThe working title for this one was \"Doctor on the Bridge\", because the choir instrumentation at the start reminded me a bit of \"The Bridge of Khazad-dûm\" (the bit after Gandalf dies in the LOTR movie). The final product aimed at being a bit closer to the original SotWW so I gave it a kind of darker twist - \"Dreaming Dead\" worked quite well as a title and Homestuck concept (And kept the alliteration). The ending I like, it channels a bit of danger and kickass before ending rather uncertainly. I wasn't fully 100% on this one to begin with - There were parts I liked and parts I didn't - And it's not as faithful a 'Doctor/Waking World' homage as it could be... The mastering also isn't brilliant - Quite bass heavy in places.\nBut. After it was used in Cascade, particularly with Rad's additions to the ending and generally going along to the animation of Jade Being Awesome and Universes Being Destroyed it's hard for me not to like it now - Particularly when the end cuts hit and everything's starting to head towards disaster. I don't think it's one of my best, and I would love to go back and try making it better, but I'm happy enough that it was used at one of the biggest moments in the comic, and still stands as a fairly harmless, simple and straightforward bit of music.",

Andrew ended up using part of it in act 2 except for the actual reversing part, but still credited it as 'Sburban Reversal', which had people asking me constantly after that if it's a real song. It wasn't really anything except for the reversing, so I eventually decided to extend it out to a full song. Since it was never actually fully in the comic, I recommended it as a bonus track.",

This includes art for tracks not included, and even one piece of track art that was so bad I didn't even use it in the original. You're welcome, archivists.\nSome songs may be rereleased on a future INHOSPITABLE music project, but the majority of the songs posted here are the only place to download this music.\nDedicated to those who helped make the original release a reality. May you find success in any walk of life you choose to take from here.

I should note that 90% of the track art was complete bullshit because I didn't actually have any big ideas back then. The beta track art sucks though. Don't apply that in your metadata. The second I finished making it I knew it wasn't going to be good.\nAnyway this song was originally made for Cool and New Music Team's '9' album, but was rejected because it sucked, and also because I got the lore I was working off of wrong. Cool and New Webcomic is not a good comic.",

        "commentary": "<i>Micheal Guy Bowman:</i>\n“Calamity” was inspired by the very same update that inspired the Pantskat craze - the image of Gamzee returning, Warhammer of Zillyhoo in hand is translated into two sonic elements, ie honks and chanting. What I’ve enjoyed really intensely about Andrew’s sense of humor in Homestuck and his other adventures is his gradual elevation of silly details onto the pedestals of utter drama, and with this track I tried to recreate that. You laughed at the honks and the chanting before - now your heart races (at least I hope).\nThere was a certain difficulty in making “Calamity” really work for me. I had a couple of different sounds I was attempting all at once, each working on their own but sort of fighting for control when mashed together. The introduction and conclusion of the song using a theme from “Walk-Stab-Walk” needed to be really punchy, while I really needed the middle of the song to glide, and the connecting bits with the chanting needed to build and build in tension. There are a lot of different sounds in the song’s palette, the most difficult of which to utilize was the enormous saw synth that dominates the middle. Getting that thing to be grand without utterly overpowering the rest of the song was incredibly difficult.\nOverall I was really satisfied with how much excitement there is in this song. It’s got a big simple melody but it doesn’t outstay its welcome. As the album opener, it sets up the stakes and excitement of Homestuck without sort of beating the point into you by lasting too long. I think of it as a cousin to “Sburban Jungle” or at least another song approached in that dramatic, electronic way.\nThe countdown sample is from a NASA recording, I believe it’s the launch of Apollo 11.",

        "commentary": "<i>Malcolm Brown:</i>\n<i>(original commentary)</i>\nAlas poor Vriska. This scene stood out quite a bit from the Scrapbook Near-end-of-act Scratch-a-thon as being yet more humility to Vriska as a character - first hinted at during John's talk with her around the whole 'lifdoff' time (which is also why most of the song is taken from lifdoff.)\nThe idea was to create something vaguely romantic and a bit tragic for the whole 'd8' thing. I used lifdoff as a starting point because that's become my sort of unofficial 'John' theme - It's quite light and goofy but reasonably heroic and fantastical. Showtime shows up at around 2:17, shortly followed by a slightly modified lift from Death of the Lusii (as mentioned previously in this topic). After that it slides into an additionally modified version of Ruins/Awakening for reasons that are hopefully obvious and also because I like that tune\nThe main reason I made this is because Vriska's had a but few moments when she wasn't terrorizing everybody and generally acting the huge bitch. Add to this the whole 'fat vriska' thing, and the very bombastic music she's had thus far... It was nice to give her last bit of humility a soundtrack.\nAnd the reason Vriska's actual theme doesn't show up anywhere is because I find it difficult to work with as it's kinda crazy  /excuse.\nIt took me about half a day to get the tambourines sounding decent and they still don't sound like what I imagined they would...\nAlso I was trying to channel some of the style from the music of the Little Big Adventure games. The soundtrack for thems' awesome and ya'll should go listen to it!\n<i>(tumblr version)</i>\n“DYRM” was essentially cre8ed as a sort of 8acking track to the John and Vriska ‘date’ sequence (around about here). The idea was to do a sort of schlocky romantic 8allad that combined elements of Johns goofiness but with the tragedy that hey - Vriska’s dead.  Over the course of it, we travel through John and Vriska’s memories,  and she’s trying to get him to remem8er something important, so there’s that element too.  It’s kinda sad, 8ut in a way it’s also a 8it of a cele8ration of Vriska - She’s surprisingly polarizing with a lot of the fan8ase, as the 8est characters often are... :p\n<b>THE NAME</b>\nI can’t immedi8ly recall if the phrase “Do You Remem8er Me?” is said by Vriska........ I think it was, 8ut it’s a faff trying to navigate around that 8it of the comic (I often like na88ing song titles out of the dialogue itself - That’s where At The Price Of O8livion came from and of course Sea Hitler’s Water Apocalypse. If not, well it felt like as good a title as any. :p The ‘8’ helps immediately recognise the subject matter.\n<b>THE TRACK</b>\nIt’s primarily “lifdoff”, which I started using a sort of personal theme of John. Other slight inspirations for this track are “Anthem Part 2” from The Truman Show and a little 8it of the music of Little 8ig Adventure (primarily the use of woodwinds/percussion).\nIt starts off with a simple lightened lifdoff, which carries it for a while.  The percussion at 1:09 was fun to sequence - It’s mostly just a collection of taiko samples from the EWQL play library that are quite fun to work with, particularly some the articulation (The ‘roll’ you hear is one of ‘em). What I think works quite well is the power of the Taikos with the lightness of the woodwinds - Gives it quite an emotional punch.\n1:33 is almost directly L8A inspired (The layering of the woodwind melody on 8rass I’m sure I got from there).  At this point we’re 8uilding up to play the ‘Death of the Lusii/Awakening’ 8it with a sort of alternate chord progression, but we sneak in a Showtime reference around 2:16.\n2:26 is meant to directly correlated to These Two panels and is a reference to this track.\nThen it 8uilds up to the main section of Awakening at around 3:30.  Given that the main theme is a sort of dreamlike afterlife, it felt appropri8 ::::p\nAnd we end! Uncertain cadences all round!\nOverall there’s quite a 8it I like about this one. The Percussion doesn’t vary much, which lets it down I think (It’s 8asically just the same loop for most of the song, something I’m hilariously guilty of in most everything I make :p) but it did the jo8 in giving Vriska a good sendoff.\nOh yeah - The reason it doesn’t use any of Vriska’s theme is because I find that theme a 8it........ All over the place ::::p Don’t get me wrong, it’s a cool 8it of music, 8ut I don’t find it as easy to play a8out with than other tracks.  8lame my laziness!\nI also fully suspect I missed some ‘8’s somewhere........ This stuff’s harder than it looks.  God help me if I try to commentary another gorram Terezi track ::::p",

Originally labeled Nether, at least as the piece began to formulate, the first part quickly developed in what I hoped would be a style reminiscent of Russell Brower’s music for Outland in World of Warcraft, primarily the Outland Suite and Netherstorm (what the first name referenced).\nI completed most of the piece without drums or effects at first, but felt something was missing.  After messing around with some different bits of drum samples, I found beats that were suitable for what I was going for, and those helped give more definition to the meter of the piece as much of it was long chords that made it hard to distinguish at times, then added some occasional filter effects to increase the overall spacey feel.\nAfter everything was in place, I listened through it multiple times and just began to imagine Karkat’s monologue about how everything was his fault and the phrase “Galactic Cancer” stuck.",

        "commentary": "<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>\nThe [[album:Squiddles!]] album gets no love. There, I said it. I’ve mentioned before how awesome it is and how dramatically it has undersold compared to the rest of our material, but apparently everyone is too terrified of its My Little Pony meets Cthulu approach to give it a shot. Trust me, you’ll like it more than you think you will.\nAnyway, one of the most surprising tracks on that particular album is “Ocean Stars”, a peaceful, mysterious little ditty imagined by Mark with a nautical theme in mind. I thought it had a beautiful little structure, and I guess the song must have stuck with me because at some point I found myself playing its chords over and over on my keyboard faster and faster until I was sure it would make for a great little indie rock inspired track. So I did just that.\nThis song takes its cues most heavily from “Regatta de Blanc” by the Police and “Life in Technicolor” by Coldplay - the meditatively simple rock backup is accompanied by a huge chorus of wordless vocals provided by countless overdubs of Tavia and myself. These middle voices are bookended by the twinkling bell sounds in the high range and the rumbling drums and guitar in the low range to make for a very full mix that really surprised me with its depth. I threw in some slowed-down bubble sounds (the same samples from “Mister Bowman Tells You About the Squiddles”) to create the ocean ambiance, something I’d really gotten the chance to hear on a scuba dive I’d done over the summer.\nThis is another example of a song that has the “just right” feeling about its length. I could probably have easily repeated the vocals endlessly as though I was attempting to induce transcendental meditation - it would probably have had the same effect as “Hey Jude” or any number of other great songs. Owing though to my sense that this album was going to be a long one (my contributions alone come out to more than 20 minutes of music) I decided to capitalize on having achieved the harmony and just let it end when its thought was fully expressed, not unlike the original composition by Mark.",

        "commentary": "<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>\nBefore going into a description of this track, I must make a long-overdue rebuttal to the factors that overshadowed its reception. Yes, I know this song and its track art pertain to the Wayward Vagabond. Yes, I know it’s sad that Andrew “killed off” the Wayward Vagabond on the same day that this album was released. No, I had no idea that would happen nor do I care how incongruous the song’s mood seems in relation to that particular plot point.\nAnyway, now that I finally said my keep on that, “Escape Pod” was a really really fun track to do. It’s a rock track with a feelgood video game attitude - I’ve heard it described as Sonic music a lot, though to be fair my main reference were Nintendo games, particularly Earthbound from which I borrowed the deliberately fake brass. It also shares some similarities with the Mario sound, kind of really owing to the competitive games such as Mario Kart and Mario Party.\nThe track also pulls a lot from actual rock music - the Roxy Music track “Street Life” was a big cue here, and the start-stop structure on the second chorus was really inspired by Tally Hall’s track “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/8sV1EOJQTEI\">Greener</a>” of which the effect can only be described in exotic dance. I really wanted to pull out the stops on this one and make it catchy as hell, but apparently the two tracks book-ending it on Volume 8 steal its thunder.\nWhat more can be said about it? This is about as totally poppy (or perhaps J-poppy) as I get. Compared to stuff like “Greenhouse” and “Squiddle Samba” this track is right up my alley. It in contrast with some of the other stuff that I’ve made appearing on the very same album (the minimalist piece “Gust of Heir” which I collaborated on with James Dever comes to mind) you’ll see that I can go just as far in the saccharine direction as I can into the abstract. For me range has always been an asset I’ve felt was important to nurture, so with Volume 8 I set the pace for my work ethic on Ithaca in terms of never settling to have “found my sound” no matter how well any one idea works.",

Good thing for Jit and I that, like the two girls in that famous scenario, we each have our own swagga and wear those dresses like the hot young messes we are. Wow, don’t quote me on that. (Too late - DPF)\nAnyway, while “Frog Forager” is almost immediate in its “aw man, yeah, it’s THIS kind of tune” factor for avid listeners of Homestuck music, my ditty “Frog Hunt” seems to hit a lot of people out of left field. Maybe it’s because I was busy surprising myself with this one as well.\nI’ve mentioned Weather Report a few times as an influence, and while I can’t bring even a fraction of that band’s musicianship to my work, I really attempted to bring their sense of atmosphere to the piece. There’s a lot of elements thrown in there - the wacky time signature (17/8 if I recall correctly), the meandering syncopated piano, the funk breaks, all that latin percussion, plus a pile of odd sound effects. I threw in some frog ambiance using some really odd synthesizers and a toy accordion as well.\nThe point of this song was to kind of put the action, the drama, and all that teenage chemistry on hold so I could focus on a moment in the story that might be just a little bit more peaceful. Going on a safari for frogs on a newly-awakened alien forest world seems to beckon a very different angle than the heated stakes typically associated with Homestuck. Plus, I’ve always felt that the environment of Homestuck deserves a little more attention given that nearly 99% of all art generated by the fans are homages to their favorite characters and not the fantastic places imagined by Andrew.",

        "commentary": "<i>Malcolm Brown:</i>\n<i>(original commentary)</i>\nThis was an idea borne of two things. Firstly the Dave & Jade vs Noir battle in the banner (Original title was 'Redshift'), and secondly a post-scratch Dave trying to regroup with all the kids (hence - 'Unite' - keeping to the kind of single-world direction thing HS has going for it i.e. Descend, Ascend, Cascade, etc).\nThe main premise was to have quite a hefty beat (Dave), bass - including a slap bass solo (Jade), piano (John) and violin (Rose). The premise being as the song continues each part contributes until the end, where all 4 play in sync (hence... er... 'Synchronization').\nThere's the tiniest influence from Showtime (again). It was also my first attempt at some vague chiptuniness in a while, which may or may not have worked... You decide!\nThe breakbeat drum thing was also fun to do.\n<i>(commentary redux)</i>\nThe idea behind this guy was something similar to the traditional idea of some HS songs being about movement (“Descend”, “Ascend”, “Upward Movement”), so in this case it’s 4 things moving, together as one.  It was becoming reasonably clear that post-scratch, we’d be separating The beta kids up a bit, and ideally, once the dust settled, they would all meet up again - This track’s effectively the kids overcoming whatever barriers in their way to unite.\nThat was the original idea, anyway.\nIt was primarily Dave centered, because in my personal interpretation of Dave I’ve always seen him as a bit of Roadie - always working behind the scenes to help people out in a lateral manner - as opposed to facing shit head on.  He’s also (and again this is personal interpretation) occasionally presented as the least capable of the 4.  Part of it presumably stems from the contrast between Bro, who is so frighteningly capable it hurts, and living in that shadow while trying to emulate him but not quite reaching it is quite a defining trait of Dave.\nThat’s not to say he’s useless, I mean he’s died less than John, and he’s also not afraid to think laterally about problems and cheat (“Shenanigans”), but there’s been a few bits where you get the feeling he wishes he was a bit more of the hero his kin are.\nUnite Synchronization is essentially a chance for a Strider to shine, to get the band back together and to prepare an ass kicking.\nDetails time!\n<b>The Track:</b>\nWe start with a moment of contemplation, or at least an establishing shot of somewhere.  Then bam - We’re moving.  The main hook of this piece is the C - G# - D# - G# pattern, which is probably primarily influenced from Sonata Arctica’s “The Cage” (Though The Cage is a different key and pattern, but the progression is similar and just has a really nice epic feel).\nAt 0:29 we get the main theme of US played on piano - We’re representing John here.  Throughout the song I pull in the associated kids instruments but make sure to constantly have the drums going - As if Dave’s grabbing each one individually and playing alongside them.  The bass is supposed to be in a constant “running” kind of theme throughout the track. An unbelievably cliched dance-y snare drum fill leads us out into the beginning of the middle section.\nThe guitar’s actually the same guitar sample I used in just about everything these days, but gated - I haven’t done any gating for yonks and figured for the sort of dance-y nature of the track it’s probably not a bad choice.\nAt 1:09, we get the alternate-Showtime (The first few notes are the main melody of Showtime), then at 1:24 we’re back into US main melody.  This is all done of Violin, which is of course Rose’s signature instrument. I also like the harmony on this one...\n1:40’s where I try my hand at some breakbeats.  These are actually quite difficult, and since the original slicing sounded a bit odd I also overlap a standard drum loop on top of it - The result is a ridiculous amount of percussion for a solo and a bit of funky panning for good measure.\nThe break is essential. Even Striders’ needs to pause for breath.\nWith the bass coming in we’re in Jade territory at 1:56.  The bass solo here is kinda pulled out of anywhere, but has a kind of Sonic-the-Hedgehog feel to it.\n2:20 we bring the percussion back in (A bar late, I love the delay there) and the violin’s brought more harmony with it.  Now here the sensible thing to do to keep up the original metaphor is to have the Piano, Slap Bass AND violin playing (Geddit? At this point all the Kids are together and rocking out) but for some reason I went with a bunch of other voices.  I guess there’s still bass.... And the choir could maybe be John singing along? I’m not sure... Potentially missed a good opportunity there... But I’m still happy with it.\nAnd that’s US in a nutshell!\n<b>The Flash:</b>\nSo despite it not being the exact context original thought of, the 2-part Flash actually manages to fit the original theme albeit with different kids.  Plus it’s Strider centric, so that’s another plus, and once again I get to dramatically cut to silence while someone dies :D\nBut then everyone’s alive by the end of it, so that’s got to be a record turnaround!\nIt is remarkably disturbing how seriously on the ball Dirk is.  Not only does he paradox up his own reincarnation with a bucket and his own head, he manages to resurrect two ladies and get them and himself time-warped to Jake.\nThis after his little presentation on Derse with Hearts’ head.\nI’d like to see Dave match that. :p",

        "commentary": "<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>\nTwo of the tracks I put on Volume 8 were collaborations with other Homestuck musicians, something I’ve been meaning to do more of because two heads are usually better than one. The first of the two was “Gust of Heir”, a track that James Dever wrote and for which I did the production.\nJames and I are both fans of minimalism, specifically the work of Philip Glass. An eerie-looking autographed program from the Philip on Film tour graces the wall of my room, and the primary piece of music that got me interested in composition is Einstein on the Beach, a five-hour opera consisting largely of slowly-evolving repeated figures using chanted numbers and solfege. Those otherwise unfamiliar might know his music better from the many movies he’s scored including Secret Window, The Truman Show, and The Hours.\nAnyway, I knew right away where James was coming from when he sent me a midi demo of “Gust of Heir” though originally it was arranged as a piano solo. Without access to a pro recording situation as on the Sburb piano suite, we knew there would have to be an alternate solution, hence the electronic approach. I played pretty heavily with a set of new sounds, specifically the soundfonts of Ethan Winer, an audio professional whose work was recommended by Radiation a good while back.\nAs I have on many occasions I took cues from <a href=\"http://www.rtqe.net/ObliqueStrategies/\">Oblique Strategies</a> to get some ideas for the arrangement. Part of the intrigue in producing this piece was that it was fully written, meaning that in some ways I was boxed-in to a complete journey for the song to take musically yet in others free to really explore and discover a unique sound for the song. I really played toggling a slew of effects until this tune became rendering hell for my computer. I stepped a bit outside my own range of comfort and got some drum loops from Clark Powell to really polish off the piece, adding a touch that otherwise would probably have eluded me.",

With little conscious attempts at maintaining structure (other than the section after the intro, which appears a few times to hold things together), it can come off as a wild ride through a bunch of interesting ideas just sort of strung together like a glass mobile made with craft glue and shiny twine.  And that is a pretty accurate description.\nThe piece was sort of an experiment for me, filled with a lot of concepts that might even have needed a separate piece to flesh them out properly, but I made this piece with the Volume 8 submissions deadline looming over head (I think it was a little under a week until final decisions on tracks were supposed to be).\nThis is also an example of a piece where I set out with a clear mindset for what I wanted.  Seeing there was no piece based on Echidna and Jade’s encounters (Radiation didn’t show us his tracks until around when the order was being decided hehe), I wanted something majestic and regal, something befitting of a monstrous queen in ancient stone halls of a frozen world.  Eventually it developed into a sort of audio tour of Echidna’s palace and highlighted the conversation, never fully revealed, that took place between Jade and Echidna as they struck a deal.",

Originally for The Wanderers, because there weren’t any WQ tracks and I liked her portrayal in the comic, I wanted something regal, almost stoic, but also forlorn.\nWith the beginning, I imagined her away from the others in their camp, sitting alone on some stone at night and listening to an old music box, one of few possessions that she could have salvaged from Prospit.  From there she reminisces, from her perspective, on the progression of the session and her foresight of and departure from the impending devastation of Prospit.\nIn the end, she closes the trinket, accepts her new fate, and returns to her fellow exiles.",

While making this all I could imagine was a bizarre Andrew Hussie Elmer Fudd hunting 'Scwatches'...\nMore or less my first attempt to do something in this style. Also, surprisingly, most of it was played live on keyboard into the sequencer (not something I normally do) and then heavily quantized to fix my wonky playing. It gives it a <i>slightly</i> more organic feel, most noticeable on the chords during the 'Explore' section at the end (Which may also owe a little bit to the Monkey Island soundtrack).\nBasically a bit of music for Andrew's huntin' of Scratch shortly before the end of act. Included is the \"AAAAAHHH FUCKING WOLF!!\" moment for good measure (That was added after the first draft to Rad's suggestion). There was even talk of getting some grumbly vocals from the man 'imself, but alas...\nHad quite a bit of fun doin' this one. Also quite proud of the name  Even if I do have to occasionally explain it to people who don't read the comic...",

Soon some big drums and some spacey guitars found their way into the mix (in my attempts to make something on the line of ambient black or doom metal).  Finally, I added Dave’s “blast off” to help Rose with a metal-ified version of Atomyk Ebonpyre (which people keep requesting a full version of... maybe).\nThis was another track that I had a clear design for, following as best as I could the events surrounding Rose and Dave’s chat on Derse before creating the Green Sun, focusing more on the atmosphere surrounding the debacle than what they talked about.\nAfter putting the original version up for the team to see, Plazmataz offered to spruce things up.  And they did.  And it was awesome.  And then Radiation said he could make some crazy drums for the last section.  And he did.  And it was awesome too.\nAnd that was how Virginia was founded!",

        "commentary": "<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>\n“Revered Return” began as a track called “Dirgeish”, a .pxtone composition that Nick had completed some time ago but never managed to squeeze into an album. Because as a chip tune it had been long overlooked, I decided to take a whack at producing it in a different style for inclusion on Volume 8. I had been looking for a piece that would work as a rock tune, and “Dirgeish” really struck me because of the heavy involvement of drums, its steady pace, and dynamic structure.\nThe unique challenge of arranging “Revered Return” was pinning down exactly what was what - “Dirgeish” had maximized use of its resources as an electronic composition, shifting instrumentation several times in ways that wouldn’t translate to a rock context. I found myself in a very subjective position, kind of picking and choosing what things would stay in and what things would be changed, while overall trying to maintain the original structure of the song.\nThe structure I think might be the most unique part of “Revered Return” - it doesn’t waste time by really repeating itself a lot. Nine out of ten times I work on a song I find myself writing or arranging something that moves in a very basic structure like ABAB or AABA or other variants, etc. “Dirgeish” gave me the challenge of establishing coherency in a piece that seemed to move almost completely linearly, and I made sure to preserve its sort of ABCDEFGBA-type structure in arranging “Revered Return” for Volume 8.\n<i>Nick Smalley:</i>\nRemember that thing about ORGMaker? Yeah, this song, too. Except add me asking Andrew Huo to help finish it and Bowman to ramp it up, and you’ve got Revered Return. :3",

Hence, for Volume 8, I decided to do a more serious version of “How Do I Live” that doesn’t mortify me entirely.\nI always had thought of “How Do I Live” as a breakup song, so as an anthem of dependency between generic 90’s lovers I was underwhelmed. However, in Con Air it’s meant to be the love theme of a woman whose husband serves in the military, giving the song a very different meaning. The stakes are not whether the singer’s lover will stay or leave but whether they will live or die, a thought that is instantly more resonant for anyone who has been in love I think.\nThe trick to this one for me was cutting out all the bullshit really - the ridiculous key change is removed and the drums are minimal to the extent of sounding like a funeral march. Rather than starting off with chipper little electric organs and keyboards, this version takes a cue from “Purple Rain” and uses only electric guitar and vocals for the first minute. The vocals start off sounding a million miles away and are subtly brought closer and closer until the other instruments join in on the second verse.\nI added a new bridge section in so that Thomas Ferkol could have a chance to play some real guitar in this one, and of course he showed his colors as a metal guitarist, sending me a duet between harmonized voices. David Ko also appears on this track as the gently-spoken backup vocalist.",

        "commentary": "<i>Solatrus:</i>\n<i>(original commentary)</i>\nAnyway, man, where to begin on this one? My most famous song, one of the proudest moments of my musical career, etc. etc. I could go on.\nBut I’ll start with the roots.\nFrost didn’t start off as the theme for the Land of Frost and Frogs. It started off as the theme for the Land of Thought and Flow. As I’ve mentioned in a previous post on this song, you really need to look at <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/images/storyfiles/hs2/02522.gif\">this image</a> to understand what went through my head.\nRemember that image? Yeah. Okay. Now then, go listen to the first 30 seconds of Frost while staring at that image.\nGot it?\nGood.\nThat’s how it started.\nAnd then Andrew asked me to use it in the animation and it got renamed. But, considering half of the song no longer fit the new theme, I rewrote the second half to include a lot more percussive instruments to give that icy feeling.\nFrankly, I’m not sure what’s more well known, the really ethereal arpeggio that opens the song, or the industrial drums that drive it.\n<i>(commentary redux)</i>\nI can’t really make a post about this song without mentioning the above flash animation and the following image:\n<img src=\"media/misc/02522.gif\" width=\"650\" height=\"450\">\nBecause, really, if I didn’t, I wouldn’t be explaining a significant amount of the story behind this song.\nThis image of Terezi standing in the Land of Thought and Flow is what inspired the opening arpeggio for Frost. The whole Land’s environment is fascinating to me, and I simply had to write a theme for that medium world. As I have probably mentioned, my preference in writing music is for settings, which gives me my really ambient sound, contrary to other musicians on the team who prefer to write melodical songs describing emotions and people.\nI ended up realizing an industrial kit would work extremely well for an unusual drum beat, particularly to contrast the incredibly ethereal sound I had already established. Hell, this song is so ambient people have a hard time telling what the melody is… and no, it’s not the french horn. :D\nEventually the arping bassline comes in and all is good.\nAnyway, I was really hoping that Terezi’s land would be explored more, but that never happened. I ended up getting contacted by Andrew to feature this in the comic, and I was really ecstatic. My music went from a few dozen people listening to it regularly, before I joined the team, to probably a few thousand after Volume 5. And then with this feature, I jumped to having hundreds of thousands of people listening to one of my songs. And it’s grown since then.\nThat was a really mind blowing, and really awesome. I’ve had very few proud moments in my life more worthy than this one.\nAfter the feature, though, I scrambled to improve the song’s quality. I changed around a few things in the first half (most notably making the whole mix a bit quieter), and pushed the melody a bit more forward. The second half, I basically swapped out this very strange sounding piano improvisation I did with the percussion (vibes, glockenspiel) instruments and a saw pad for lead. The replacements work incredibly well for trying to give an icy sound, and I’m pleased with how it turned out.\nI don’t know if I’ll ever go back to doing songs that are this ambient and minimalist, because my composing skills have progressed significantly since then, and I require much more complexity in my work. Also, now that this song is actually over two years old (for me), I’ve noticed how flawed it is.\nBut nonetheless, this is probably one of my best songs, and it’s well loved by the Homestuck fandom. That’s good enough for me.",

It was also my first remix since I made that Skaia remix.\nHave I mentioned that Alex Rosetti’s compositions are pretty incredible? They are. You should go give him some love.\n<i>(commentary redux)</i>\nWoo, my first official remix since my Skaia remix on Volume 5!\nSo as I’ve probably mentioned, I’m a huge fan of Alex Rosetti’s work, and this song is absolutely no exception. I had been wanting to do something with Crystalanthemums since first listening to it. Coincidentally, it immediately proceeded my Skaia remix.\nAt the time, I really had no idea on who anyone was on the team, so it never really sunk in that I should do that remix until December of 2010.\nObviously at this point I had gained an interest in drum and bass music, which explains the sound, yet I still had a very soft and ethereal sound reminiscent of the original song.\nOf course, I really pushed the energy up, which made it a lot of fun. I jokingly said to Alex after Volume 6 came out that while his song was at the top of the echeladder, my remix was god tier, in part due to Vriska in her God Tier outfit being there. :D\nAnyway, on to the song.\nSo the song opens with a really interesting sounding ostinato, which is actually the same notes that open Crystalanthemums: E, D, B, A, E, D, B, D.\nHowever, I really gated the length of the note to make it become such a short blip that the sound barely registers. On top of that I gave it a delay and combined with the gate it sounds nothing like the original motif.\nAnd then when I open the gate on the note length you hear the ostinato faaaaar better.\nA lot of people missed this, actually. :D\nI have to say I really love the chord progression Alex went with in Crystalanthemums, and it was incredibly fun to make that bassline, which is actually a layered bass, but not a note-for-note bass. This is actually a pretty common thing to do, with the lower bass just playing simple sustained notes, and the higher bass is more animated.\nThough I’ve definitely grown to prefer warm sawtooth basslines, this bass has a really nice quality that’s almost a square. The filter based attack is pretty sweet sounding, too.\nI really was happy with how the drum beats layered in at 2:16, though honestly, I was really out of practice of doing any sort of breakbeat stuff.\nFun fact, this was the first song I used Gross Beat on. What’s Gross Beat? It’s something a Time Lord of Gallifrey would approve of in music. :D If you listen to the stutter effects heard in the song, mostly in the latter half, that’s where I start using Gross Beat to do some crazy time shifting stuff.\nMan, I really love what I did on this song.\n...I need to do another Homestuck remix, don’t I?",

Like Moonshine it still has a soft spot in my heart. It’s not as compositionally impressive in my opinion, but it was the first in a long line of quirky tracks I have made for Homestuck. The vibraphone and electric organ were incredibly fun to use, and the whole thing ended up having an Elfman/Kirkhope vibe to it. Now, I don’t have synesthesia, but for some reason whenever I think about this song, I think “green”. Just some useless trivia for you.\nLooking back on Drawing Dead as a whole, do I think it was a good album? No, not really. It was good for us at the time, but it was so all over the place, almost completely devoid of mastering, many of the songs used inferior samples, and most of us just weren’t as experienced with composing back then. Mostly it was a case of having no centralized idea of what the style of music should be, and the clashes that followed. I don’t mean that to knock any of us in any way. It was an important step for all of us as musicians and we have been constantly improving since then. I still look back fondly at it, since it was my first ever album release, after all.",

At this point in terms of instrumentation, we were still mostly striving for faithfulness to the canon Midnight Crew \"band,\" as can be seen in <a href=\"http://www.mspaintadventures.com/extras/ps000018.html\">the Extras page</a> wherein the MC fill 'em with midnight (bottom), so Hauntjam employs trombone, string bass, piano, clarinet, and sax (I forget which because I've lost the file and am not a band person, but I think it was alto). From there on, it was fairly straightforward to write a haunting refrain and then solos for each instrument. I will admit I got a little writerblock'd for the second part, which was sort of a brief modulation to the dominant, so it sounds a little strange. But it still has its own little charm, with the almost annoying trill put in for a spooky ghost-like effect. In Hauntjam, Bowman did some good stuff with bringing out moving parts in the first refrain. In Hauntjelly, Xerxes emphasizes the spookiness by changing instruments for more electric organ.",

Since the very beginning of Homestuck, Andrew had this idea that the kids would have fake bands they were into, and we would make MySpace band pages with a few of their songs on them as a fun supplement to the comic, in the same spirit as <a href=\"https://dstrider.blogspot.com/\">dave strider’s blog</a> or <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/sweet-bro-and-hella-jeff\">SBaHJ</a>. <s>(both of which I would link to if tumblr wasn’t bugging out right now and preventing me from doing so)</s>\nThe first one was the Midnight Crew, and Andrew made the cover art before anything else happened, if I recall correctly. That project hung around for a while until the Midnight Crew Intermission, when Andrew decided to expand the “fake band” idea and release our MC as a full album on bandcamp, along with the Homestuck Volumes. Incidentally, I believe Squarewave and Sawtooth were originally going to be a fake band as well, and Dave even had a poster of them on his wall. Reeeaaally wish we did that one, but oh well. At least we got Anbroids.\nIn light of the fact that the Midnight Crew were going to have a real album and that I had just rejoined the team, I was eager to contribute to it. The first song I made for it was Moonshine, which strangely enough to some I’m sure, I still consider one of my better Homestuck tunes, if only technically. Yeah, the instruments I used were atrocious, but I think it would be a fun piece if it were actually played by people. I had a good idea of its form and I was really able to get into the style of music I perceived the Midnight Crew would play.\nThe instrumentation was based off the instruments each character played, with Slick on piano, Droog on sax, Boxcars on bass, and the last one I changed from Deuce’s oboe to clarinet, which is seen much more in jazz. Not that jazz oboe doesn’t exist! Still, it seems very like CD to play jazz on such an instrument. The song itself is more dissonant than most Homestuck music, having a lot of clashing harmonies and tritones which I love but can understand a lot of Homestuckers probably don’t, at least not in this context. The name “Moonshine” came out of how drunk the music sounds, especially in the middle where it picks up a bit and is more obviously in 6/8. But yeah, it uses its motivic material well and is consistent with itself, much more than I can say about many tracks in Genesis Frog for instance, which I’ll admit I got much too carried away with.",

I used to take dance classes when I was a kid, and I have very distinct memories of a kindly old woman playing bouncy piano chords in ¾ time. One of the design choices Toby and I settled on really early on was that each character would have a “room” that be the purest form of their theme. Joey feels most at home in her bedroom, which is a sanctuary from the rest of the awful house she lives in.\n<i>Toby Fox:</i>\nI think my original version of this was like 40 seconds long or something… James did a really good job fleshing it out and making it something that’s listenable for long enough to look at the Bubsy poster 40 times in a row.",

When we first came onto the project Andrew told us “it’s like a haunted house” so we really made it like… spooky but months down the line Andrew was like “ok lads reel it in it’s not actually haunted just lonely” so we switched it to piano and toned it down a bit.

Stripping down Toby’s song in this way makes it sound kinda like Luigi’s Mansion, which rules so it all worked out. This was originally going to be the theme for just downstairs. In the time since then, though we decided to have music changes based more on “narrative” and less on just “location.” You don’t spend that much time upstairs so it would seem kinda silly to have the “MAIN THEME” of the mansion be heard for the two minutes you’re in the hallway. You will see more of these dynamic music changes in ACT 2.\n<i>Toby Fox:</i>\nIt sounds kind of like Yoshi’s Story to me. This turned out to be a really tuba-heavy soundtrack somehow. Maybe that’s a good thing though.\n<i>James Roach:</i>\nWe just kept telling each other to add Tuba to things. Like some sort of Will They/Won’t They Tuba standoff.",

It is an extremely important moment in american cinema AND meta comedy. I’m honestly so surprised you hadn’t heard of it. Anyway this is based off of “SNAKE GENESIS” which I wrote first. Movie Magic!\n<i>Toby Fox:</i>\nThey probably should have also named the song that plays when you play the Snake minigame this. Just two songs with an identical name. That would be have been cool.\n<i>Cohen Edenfield:</i>\n(Hey Cohen here. several people have asked if the title is a reference to the aaron carter song. obviously it is, yes, that. James’ song titles were good but they were usually a very direct reference to what actually happened in the scene they were playing for. So I renamed them, because I didn’t want people poring over the tracklist to decode the entire plot before actually playing the game. because you would have. I know you.)",

Also him and Dammek are in a shitty rock band. So I tried to compose something that was kind of lumbering and morose-sounding, but also a bit like… a rock band?

    "commentary": "<i>Liza Fletcher:</i>\nThis album means a lot to me, for a lot of reasons. Not just because it represents literally months of planning, organization, rounds of messaging, upsets, drama, triumph and general hard work on the part of me and some very good friends of mine. Not just because we managed to get some of the top talent in the fandom to contribute not only music but track art. Not just because that talent includes music and art team members and the uniquely universally beloved superfan Dante Basco. Not just because that talent also includes many friends I love dearly, some of whom I got to know through this project.\nNo, this album is special to me because the original [[album:lofam]] holds a very dear place in my heart. It was the first album of Homestuck-related music I ever owned. I played it over and over, and read the album commentary until I damn near had it memorized. It was LoFaM which spurred me to stop lurking on the MSPA forums and dive headlong into the collective insanity we call Homestuck fandom. And right when I did so coincided with the start of the second fanmusic thread, and a guy named Underwater Basketweaving posting something he called Fighting Spirit. I downloaded it, loved it, and have been hip deep in collecting fanmusic - not just that already collected for my convenience in an album - ever since.\nFighting Spirit is in here, and its sequel, and many others I and my compatriots ran across in our scouring of not only the fanmusic thread but tindeck, soundcloud, tumblr and basically anywhere on the big wide internet where MSPA fans celebrate their love of this remarkable work of fiction through music.\nIt's my hope that, having gathered it all here for your convenience, you too are spurred to start your own search for the best, including many pieces that for one reason or another we had to leave off. The Land of Fans and Music is not just this 2-disc set or its predecessor; they're only the tip of the vast landscape of amazing talent. Come in. Explore. Get lost in it, like I did. I haven't regretted it for a second.\n<hr>\n<i>Special Thanks:</i>\n<b>-CONCEPTION/ORGANIZATION-</b><br>Lambda Bledsoe<br>Liza Fletcher\n<b>-ORGANIZATION TEAM-</b><br>Slogbait<br>Veritas Unae<br>Rachel Rose Mitchell<br>Paige 'hrmnzr\" Stanley<br>Astro Kid<br>clumsyroyalty (clumsyroyalty)<br>Shoona<br>Charles \"Crazy-8\" Neudorf<br>Catboss (Cat Boss)<br>Brad \"Avinoch\" Griffin<br>Mark \"Dagoth Xil\" Ciocca\n<b>-MASTERING-</b><br>Brad \"Avinoch\" Griffin<br>Veritas Unae\n<b>-COMMENTARY BOOKLET-</b><br>Brad \"Avinoch\" Griffin\n<b>-WEBSITE CODING-</b><br>Veritas Unae\n<b>-WEBSITE HOSTING-</b><br>AndrewNeo and skaia.net\n<b>-INSPIRATION-</b><br>Andrew Hussie &amp; What Pumpkin Studios<br>The Homestuck Music Team",

Anyways this is a song I made JUST FOR THE ALBUM!!! Wowee. There's a lot going on here. There's the intro which is like Lord English taking a proverbial shit on everything by existing or something like that, then it sort of BLEHs and goes into the main part of the song. Right off the bat you've got Sburban Jungle's marimba part played backwards on a piano, and then there's some stuff from a fan song that I don't remember the title of. THEN there's stuff from Condy's song off the unofficial ancestor album, and some stuff from some other things. There's basically a lot of things!! It's a very thing filled song.\n<i>Skylar:</i>\npaige told me the song was about doc scratch, the condesce and lord english, and since the track was titled chronology i tried to show some sort of a progression within the track art while expressing some of the background of each character.",

I'd been messing about on guitar and found that most of the first theme from Skies of Skaia was playable with harmonics in standard tuning, and only the top note wasn't possible. By returning to EADF#BE and putting a capo on at the 5th fret it was possible then to play the whole thing.\nThe piece was originally just going to be loose reworking of Skies of Skaia using lots of acoustic guitars but then the second theme felt like it needed something more. I ended up adding drums and electric instruments for the second section to lift the piece and finished off with a little guitar improv into the quiet harmonics to finish.\nI liked the alliteration in the title and it was pretty much how I thought of the piece. There's not really a reason for the hint to Sherlock Holmes.\n<i>dodostad:</i>\nI can admit that I had no idea where this was going when I painted it.

The goal was something high-energy but also a bit campy. I tried to give it a similar feel to one of the Beatdown tracks. I got a lot of great feedback from my music buds, and it evolved into the track you hear now.\nThe hardest part was deciding between RamBUNNctious and RABBunctious.\n<i>Dawn Davis:</i>\nI love Lil Seb he's my baby.<br>I'm proud of this it was really fun to do =w=",

The scene for the piece ends when she goes all vampirey on Feferi.\nRejected alternate title: 'All the colours of the rainbow (are delicious)'\n<i>Maddie Haines:</i>\nI saw the name Rainbow Rebirth and immediately wanted to do something cool with Kanaya and her fairly new rainbow drinker status, since I was pretty dang sure that was what the title was referencing.

Looking back, I have no idea why I chose to remix this song in particular; it must have just been stuck in my head that day. As one could gather from the title, this remix is supposed to be an upbeat, elecronic remix. As I was composing, it seemed to turn into a dance track of sorts. The genre still fit my idea, so I kept going. I think it was a rather successful first Homestuck remix.\n<i>plaidcushion:</i>\nThe songs this was remixed from are associated with Skaia and the battlefield, but I thought that Electrocumulus was way too high energy and fun for something like that. I decided to go for the next best thing- John speeding through Skaia and plowing through clouds in his Dad's car! As it turns out, exploded clouds are also rpetty fun to cut out with a scalpel.",

Around this time I was still really just a budding musician, and I wanted to make something heavy out of the Showtime theme by Malcolm Brown. The idea was imagining what kind of soundtrack would be backing the kids as they face Lord English in a climactic battle. I was proud of it at the time but in retrospect it never really aged that well. Despite this it remained one of my most popular works.\nAround the time I finished [[Rust Maid]] and [[Orange Hat]], I was approached for the inclusion of the remix in LOFAM2. While I was happy to have the opportunity to give people the download so many of them clamored for, I really, really had to fix so many of its glaring issuse, and as such I remastered it for the album.\n<i>devonianecho:</i>\nShowtime has always been one of the most memorable pieces of music in Homestuck, forever representing a (if not the) quintiessential \"strife\" theme. With this in mind, I think I had almost too much freedom in choosing the conflict I wanted to depict in this piece. Initially, I was going to make it John vs. Dad from Act 1... but that ended up being a little too underwhelming in comparison to the song it was for. So, in the end, I settled upon focusing the piece on a determined-looking John about to face down the underling horde at the beginning of Cascade. I'm pretty happy with the end result.",

I really think the part at the end with Black, Showtime and Beatdown works well, and I discovered that Showtime is the Homestuck equivalent of Guile's Theme: It goes with everything.\n<i>AS:</i>\nListening to Fighting Spirit the first time kind of got me nostalgic for the old Strife pages, with their chiptune music. You know, waaaay back in the beginning of the comic when the Beta kids were still on planet Earth and were being harassed by trolls. So nearly a year later, I figured that a strife page would make for an excellent cover. Admittedly action poses have always been a weakness of mine, so I probably drew each kid at least twice for this cover until I was satisfied. Still though, I'm happy with how the art came out. Hopefully I did this awesome track justice.",

Similarly to a good portion of my work Black/Liquid Negrocity's leitmotif plays a prominent feature in the composition, providing the base melody for the entire track. The idea for Irradiated spurred from [[flash:2927]], as a high-velocity and energetic track with none other than Jack Noir at the center; my goal was to take Black and give it a different feel. After a short hiatus, my track Irradiated featured in my first tribute animation <a href=\"https://youtu.be/hnG10rk91qg\">on YouTube</a> for Homestuck.\n<i>Spectrumfizz:</i>\nIrradiated is among the first Homestuck fanmusic tracks I ever heard, so I was very pleased to be able to create art to accompany it on LOFAM2. I decided to draw inspiration from AutoDevote's first HS fanimation, which to this day remains one of my favourite Homestuck videos. I'm not particularly apt at composition or shading or several other things, but I'm pretty happy with what I accomplished here.",

The more I worked on it, the more I noticed the composition was bearing a strong resemblance to Rob Douganí's \"Clubbed to Death\", so I kind of ran with that influence, and this is the result.\nWhen the Homestuck fanmusic competition was announced, I made some updates to the song and tried submitting it for that (special thanks to Jit for offering some last minute advice).\nThis song holds a lot of personal importance to me. Before this piece I had never ever brought a composition to a completed state, let alone posted it for the world to see. Obviously I still have much room for improvement, but the fact that my debut work has received such positive feedback has been a huge encouragement.\nThank you all for listening!",

        "commentary": "<i>Domble:</i>\nThe original version of the track sounded nothing like this. What I want is for people who heard the first one to think, \"wow, this guy really got less bad in a year.\" It references all the songs it originally did, whether in the same basic way (Courser, Ruins) or differently (Dawn of Man, the rose rap).\nThat one terrible LEGENDARY ENDLESS DVS SAX song I made almost went on the album instead of this and I felt like paying tribute to it, so that's where the little sax rif came from.\n<i>Christina Lillard:</i>\n(<a href=\"https://hsfanmusic.skaia.net/post/39025832110/tiny-mayo-this-is-the-last-piece-of-track-art\">Tumblr</a>)\nI had the feeling that I had to meet some pretty high expectations when I was called upon to draw this one, so I was pretty nervous about doing it. I spent a long time mulling over how I was going to go about drawing this track art after I completed the art for Stalemate. We don't know nearly as much about the denizens as we do about the kids or the trolls or even the carapacians, but I took what we do know about the beta kids' denizens and ran with it.\nThere were actually a few goofs with the original composition of this drawing - Cetus’ tail was originally pointing to the left but I then decided that having it face the right would give the overall drawing more flow. Also in Hephaestus’ section of the art I had forgotten that Davesprite was injured when he went to him to get the Deringer repaired so for the longest time he had both wings at their full length. Not much to say about Typheus’ section; I had a good idea of what I was going to do with it fairly early on.\nEchidna’s section is primarily inspired by the track art for Volume 8’s Bargaining with the Beast, as far as her design goes. I was originally going to include Jack to the right of Jade in that section, but I didn’t find anywhere to put him and I found that the composition looked just fine without him anyway! Although in this memo Jade says that Jack was with him when she was talking with Echidna and I really wanted to draw him, I just couldn’t make him fit. Perhaps I’ll try and remedy that if I ever make a high-resolution version of this!\nI knew immediately that I wanted Echidna to be the main focus out of all the denizens because she’s really important in the story since she makes Jade promise to take all the planets, the consorts, the denizens, and everything to the alpha session even if it meant Jade had to die. Then there’s Typheus, who’s facing doomed John, and Hephaestus looking down on Davesprite and offering him <b>The Choice</b>, and Cetus swimming around in the seas of LOLAR, which is now devoid of fish.\nI tried to make the sections flow together the best I could - the top areas where Cetus and Typheus’ sections blend into Hephaestus’ section kind of fade without any borders, but I decided to make little borders based on each kid’s aspect to separate each section from Echidna’s section. The breath and light symbols are done in an abstract manner while the time and space symbols are just the straight-up time and space symbols; the space one just overlaps the time one.\nI think I’ve rambled enough about this piece of track art, so I’m going to let the rest speak for itself! I hope I’ve done a good enough job living up to the LOFAM2 team’s expectations, and if I’ve exceeded them, that’s great too!\nThis has been another rambling commentary from Lune.\n(THIS TRACK ALSO CAUSED ME A LOT OF PAIN AND SUFFERING BUT IT WAS MORE LIKE “DEAR GOODNESS WHERE DO ALL THESE LAYERS KEEP COMING FROM” THAN “OH GOD HOW AM I GOING TO COLOR ALL THIS BLACK.”)\nAs another side note, the layered .lip file for this had a total of 60 layers not counting the texture layer!\nBONUS: When I was starting work on this, instead of copying the texture layer, I accidentally copied Jack over from the layered version of the Stalemate track art. I couldn’t bear to delete him from the file, so he got to stay on the condition that his layer stayed invisible. Sometimes I’d make it visible when I was bored! Poor guy just keeps getting chased by things - first an angry PM and now an angry sea denizen!)\n<i><b>Brad Griffin:</b></i>\n<s>note: Lunise wrote seven paragraphs about the creative process behind this wonderful art piece. I can only fit the first one on the page.</s>\nHere is the full commentary to the rise of the denizens track art. c:",

Dawn of Man is a favorite of mine from that album, and it also happens to be a partial remix of Sburban Jungle. In the Homestuck tradition, the natural thing to do then was mix them together, along with a cameo from Exodus, featured in SBURB. The instruments are based primarily on Dawn of Man, bringing in some of Sburban Jungle's mallet percussion and a few of my own additions. The result is Sburban Genesis, a song ultimately inspired by the mysterious origins of the game and its multi-universal legacy.\n<i>plaidcushion:</i>\nThis really sounded like a night time kind of song to me, which I think went nicely with the baby frog Jade finds on her island as a kid. He's a pretty cute little guy, but his role carries a lot of weight, so I think he fits the song pretty well.",

This was what I was originally going to use for the fan album, but I decided to drop it half way through making it on the grounds that it didn't sound like a Homestuck song. Jack Noir (and by extension, Bec Noir) always struck me as a tragic character. The way I see it, he's always violent because of the abuse he receives from the black queen. He's physically shut down all other emotions save for hatred because as far as he's concerned, there is no such thing. However things change for him when Bec becomes prototyped. He suddenly has a heart and has new feelings. Bec's influence taught him what it's like to feel for someone else, although Jack desperately tried so hard to ignore these feelings. When Jade died, Jack finally knew what it felt to lose someone so close to your heart. A tragic character indeed...\n<i>Corrina:</i>\nGiven the fact that the song references Jade's theme, I thought that I'd go with something that has to do with the characters' relationship. in the picture, I had originally intended Jade to be a sort-of ghost image, as if she wasn't really there. I wanted to show that Jack was alone, but I later changed that aspect, despite how much I loved the idea. Making her more faded created imbalance in the work, and the details were also washed out.",

It's really slow and sweet and has my favorite chord thingy ever which is the F to F minor thing going on there. It's all in all a song that you hopefully fall asleep listening to because that's what it's supposed to do!! And you might need a nap after listening to disk one.

        "commentary": "<i>Brenden Cameron:</i>\nOriginally titled 'A Heroic Death', this song was my second entry into the Homestuck Fanmusic contest, as well as the second song I've ever released in general.\nMy intention at the outset of the contest was to write a theme for Tavros, my patron Troll and a character who I thought would otherwise be under-represented among the competition. However, every time I sat down to work on the song, I found myself experimenting with several of John's themes instead. Eventually I relented and combined those experiments into a song for John.\nEven though neither of my entries was selected for the contest album, I'm still immensely grateful for the experience. The process of preparing my songs for the competition taught me a lot about music production and showed me some of the areas I might improve on in future (specifically: I need to stop quoting existing songs so much and focus on creating original melodies).\nSo again, thank you Andrew and everyone on the music team; both for that opportunity and for all your creative work which inspired me in the first place. Thanks Jit for offering some last minute advice (though I didn't get a chance to implement half of those suggestions...). And, of course, thank you Liza and Xzaz for organizing this second Homestuck Fan Music Album; your dedication and enthusiasm is truly an inspiration.\n<i>Racheme:</i>\nThis shows little John asking his older self if they saved Dad from the game. I wanted to reflect some inner workings in John's mind, he still thinks about his only family rather than simply drawing him as powerful and never giving up like in most pictures.",

As the title suggests, I wanted to write something that represented the first act of Homestuck, to capture the feeling of the story as we are introduced to its darker elements - the Wind Skims the Void flash ([[flash:82]]) is a good example to use. That page is almost like a title screen for the webcomic as a whole, not giving away a thing, but nudging ever so slightly towards things to come; likewise, the repeating piano ostinato in here pays tribute to the Chrono Trigger title music. Little did we know at the time, though, how destructive the conductor's baton can be.\nHere's hoping for a happy ending.\n<i>Fortnight:</i>\nFirst of all - I love this track, it sounds to me like the start of something new, with hope and high expectations thrown in. I drew this track art based off that mood and also the unnamed flash from Act 1, <a href=\"https://homestuck.com/story/82\">page <s>1982</s> 82</a>.",

I chose a very laid back feel to this piece, progressing fom a soft choir at the beginning, picking up an arpeggiated synth and kick on the way to a more intense section of the song. I wanted the song to flow just like the wind: starting softly, the breeze picks up gradually, when suddenly a gust of wind comes, only to leave just as fast as it came.",

I set out to create something epic, fast-paced, and exciting, but once I'd finished the first part, I found it was missing something. So I approached MSPA forumite and fellow Homestuck fan musician D. Crystal to see if he could add some guitar and drum tracks. He was happy to oblige, and the end result turned out much better than the work I could do by myself. I learned two lessons that one day: one, that two heads are better than one and collaboration is incredibly fun, and two, that electric guitars make everything better.",

It obviously didn't make the cut, and Jane ended up receiving a much more badass theme in the form of [[Cyan Beast]]. At the time when I wrote the song (around January 29, 2012), we really didn't know much about Jane beyond the fact that she was a nice girl who enjoyed baking. I tried to give her a theme that was quaint and melodic, not too energetic like my other submissions; compared to most of the other characters, Jane is very down-to-earth, which I admired. Structurally, it loosely parallels [[Fuchsia Witch]], which was originally titled \"Jake's Theme.\"\n<i>positivelymorbid:</i>\nWhen I first listened to it, I thought it was a really calm, tranquil song, so I thought maybe Jane relaxing. The more I listened to it, the more adventurous it sounded. Then it hit me, why not Jane having a picnic in LOCAH, picnics are relaxing and adventurous. Overall, I enjoyed the song, and I really enjoyed drawing this art for it.",

While pretty, it hardly showcased my abilities as a musician or a producer. So in about the span of the week, I arranged, composed, and produced a traditional string quartet, heavily inspired by cellist and multitrack recording artist, Zoë Keating. All the recording was done with only my viola and my signature production style.\nI remember it being a week of musical hell for me, but I'm quite proud of the end results. Perhaps one day, I'll be able to rerecord it with a proper quartet. One can dream at least.\n<i>Reid Slater:</i>\nI wanted to represent the beta kids reaching their godtier status while mixing in the royalty theme that Samm's song gave me. Samm said to me himself that he thought of the crowning scene in Narnia and the four thrones, and I thought it was suitable to represent them with crowns, holding the Skaia they influenced and looking content and almost relieved in each other's company. I wanted to create something happy and a little bitter-sweet, which was the feeling I got from Samm's track. And I wanted to show that sort of unity and friendship the kids have, even after all they've been through.",

I'd never made anything as complex as Indigo Archer bfeore and on top of that I had massive anxieties about getting into the competition. I was stressed out! So Blood Knight nearly never happened.\nAbout a week before the music contest ended, I was talking to my best friend and he said he thought I could make a kickass song for Karkat. I didn't really believe him at first. Karkat is one of my favourite characters and I didn't feel confident about capturing him at all. But my friend persisted and threw a few ideas at me. Eventually I found myself in Cubase making music again with my best friend to thank for it.\nImmediately, I knew it needed electric guitars. That was problematic for me as I'd never, ever gotten synthesized guitars to sound halfway decent before. Heck, I'm still not entirely sure how I managed it, but I'm super happy with how it turned out. The feel of it matches what I was going for; not quite metal, not quite a ballad, kind of melancholy but also kind of in your face. Sort of. You might be able to tell that I had an easier time making it than describing it, heh. Pretty darn proud of this piece.",

The square-wave arpeggio that you hear is probably the only thing that is now reminiscent of that remix. It was because of the harp that this grew into something different. I actually composed this while the composition was playing. I would listen to the notes I had composed, and I would just place new notes where I think they would work while listening. Somehow, everything just seemed to fit together - the violins, the synths, the percussion - everything just worked. The structure of this composition just flowed.

I had just installed a new copy of FL Studio after losing my old copy in a hard drive crash two years earlier. I imemediately threw together about five Homestuck songs in a desperate attempt to get on the music team. Shortly thereafter, I discovered about a thousand other fan musicians like myself (and also LOFAM I), and quietly accepted that I would never, ever be on an official Homestuck album.\nA year and a half later, Red Miles definitely sounds like a first attempt. My only objective was to try to make the most over-the-top, attention-grabbing chiptune-metal song I could muster, so I threw in every trope I knew: the pipe organ, the wall of 8-bit synths, the Inferno electric guitar patch, and the Sburban Jungle motif (which I would use many, many more times).

After re-arranging it into a solo piano piece, I sat on it for a while. Eventually I began to work on another remix, but forgot about it. Then the song was nominated for Land of Fans and Music 2, and I rushed to polish up the song now that I had better tools and more skill. But I'd lost the original file, and the only remaining part of the scrapped remix was the right-hand piano notes (luckily, those were the most important part of the song)! The new remix is exotic and a bit hypnotic, syumbolizing John and Vriska's journey through the surreal and fantastic memory-realms of the afterlife.\n<i>Cap:</i>\nOriginally, I planned to do a sentimental image of Vriska standing in the snow, but it turned out pretty lame. Then I figured hey, since I'm making somethin for a fantastic song for an amazing troll, why not make the piece almost as gr8t as her? So the snow idea melted and turned into this bizarre, dreambubble-ish creation!\nNow imagine my surprise when I heard that Ascenzo later remixed the song and made it like 16,777,216 times cooler.",

I wanted the piece to have that 'Bowman' quality to it, while still refraining from outright copying his ideas off in any particular way - the heavy use of guitars and fleeting synths was my way of capturing the emotion that Bowman injects into his music, to bring across his characterization. Ultimately, the piece ends the way it started - it is a brief window through which the troubled characters may be projected and represented.",

That, however, didn't pan out, and it ended up turning into a fast-paced,  high-energy strife theme more in the vein of \"The Curse of Sorrow\" from Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia (the only Castlevania game I've actually come close to beating), especially the organ, electric guitar, and snappy drum kit. The main melody has some resemblance to the Black King's theme from [[Rex Duodecim Angelus]] by Malcolm Brown, but not enough to qualify as a remix or arrangement.\n<i>Ducky Senpai:</i>\nI initially had no idea what I was going to do for this song. I skimmed through the tracks and noticed this one by Willow Ascenzo (who did some of my favorites on coloUrs and mayhem: Universe A like [[Teal Hunter]] and [[Violet Mariner]]), and I was instantly sold probably because of my love for pipe organs. Anyway, for a lack of better inspiration, I used the description left on soundcloud - \"Final battle with Lord English.\" Tie that to Aranea's mentioning that Jake was destined to beat Lord English, and I had my inspiration. The lineart took much longer than it should have since my tablet had been freaking out and I haven't gotten the new one yet, but the coloring went quite smoothly.",

It's supposed to be a Showtime for the new generaiton, a strife theme for Jake English - although the melody ended up sounding more like Dissension than Showtime. The progression is spposed to be Showtime-esque as well, starting from the piano refrain, going into a chiptune-esque portion, and finally building to a BOSS FIGHT version, using punchy drums (the punchiest!) to simulate gunshots.\nSo close your eyes and imagine Jake doing that thing where he flies through the air shooting both guns at once. Yes. So sweet. Wouldn't it be great if there were an animated flash to go with it? That would be SUPER SWEET.\n(Bonus fun fact: the last 30 seconds of the song was actually the first part to be conceptualized!)",

Whilst I think that structurally the track is a little too similar to the original and if I were to make another remix I would do things quite differently, this piece was the one which began to outline my chiptune style which I've since developed with my other Homestuck tracks. My main influences with the chiptune are from the SID and Yamaha chips found in the C64 and Sega Mega Drive respectively, and as such many synth and percussive elements from each can be heard in my work.\n<i>PV:</i>\nTo fit a remix of one of my favorite Homestuck themes, I wanted to make the Strife scene between Dad and John in my own style, while still holding somewhat true to the original.

The first Land of Fans and Music had two of my early songs on it, and I felt it was appropriate that I do my best and show how far I'd come in a year for the second album. \"Ave Dei Novi\" takes its cue, partially, from the bombastic and incredible Gundam Unicorn soundtrack by Sawano Hiroyuki, especially in the orchestra and percussion grooves, which I worked very hard on. I think I'm most proud of the bongo groove breakdown in the middle and the \"Atomyk Ebonpyre\" section near the end. Those two parts ended up especially fantastic.\n<i>xkoraxayomex:</i>\nOverall I feel that the artwork suits the piece in terms of relativity and presentation. I think it looks refined and somewhat detailed, but there is room for improvement. When I read the title for the piece, Ascension, I automatically thought back to Jade's god tier, as it is simply gorgeous and I just love it. It was a milestone for her becoming an even more essential character in Homestuck.\n<i><b>Lambda Bledsoe:</b></i>\nthis song was originally titled \"ascension\", but there was to be another song on lofam2 with a similar title (\"god tier ascension\") (except now there isn't) so wmm changed it to\"ave dei novi\" which translates to \"hail the new gods\"",

[[Umbral Ultimatum]] remains one of my favorite HS songs, and I wanted to do something in 3/4 time using the opening melody. The song's development is kind of a blur to me now, I was busy with work and was experiencing some anxiety problems, and threw the song together over a two or three-day period, but it obviously took a very dark turn somewhere along the way. Whatever happened, I'm still pretty pleased with how it turned out.",

It wasn't meant for Homestuck, it wasn't meant for Tumblr or anyone to see it. But a fantastic friend of mine told me about the Homestuck Music competition, so I figured why not. I sent this in after tweaking it a bit, and just for fun, threw it up on Tumblr. I then left for vacation, but still had internet access. I came back to see my song exploded on Tumblr, and was promptly getting upwards of 1,000-3,000 views a week. Needless to say, I was ecstatic. The song itself was kind of... my own personal blend? I love songs that combine organic and inorganic elements, and with Homestuck being the big thing on the block lately, I decided to try it out. As evidence by this album, it didn't make it, but it certainly was a big hit. However, what's funnier is that the version I put on Tumblr was the unmastered version, so when I put the mastered version up, it didn't get nearly as many hits as the unmastered version.\nA lot of people have asked me whether or not I'm going to make a second Homestuck track. And as much as I love the motivation from fans to do so, I don't think I could handle trying to one-up a piece like this and failing. So, here's to you, Homestuck.\n<i>dodostad:</i>\nFor me the song was about alpha kids, no question about it. It took me a long time to come up with a composition that I liked and that seemed to fit the song. LOOK OUT FOR THE MILES JANE",

I'd only just caught up with the archives when I was set a composition assignment for university. Having never used Logic to compose before, I had fun playing with a bunch of the different inbuilt instruments. When I found the koto, I knew exactly what I wanted to do. I tried to make it sound somewhat ethereal and otherworldly to represent the Incipisphere in all its beautiful weirdness. To try to do that, I threw a whole lot of reverb and delay at pretty much every track. I really did not know what I was doing, but it was fun.\nThe vocal lines were an afterthought. Actually, no, they were less than an afterthought. They weren't actually something I thought I should include at all, but the assignment had a requirement of at least four recorded audio tracks. I threw those lines together at home on Cubase (I don't actually have a Mac, let alone Logic!) the morning the piece was drew it, slapped them onto the piece with Logic that day and got the assignment in just in time. But in the end, I think they enhanced the feel of the piece, so I'm kind of glad I had to chuck them in there!\n<i>Spectrumfizz:</i>\nThis is probably my favoured piece from my two more serious ones. I wanted to make a layout reminiscent of an actual planetarium, and I think I achieved that well (the \"strings\" hanging up the planets are simultaneously that and the kids' houses built up towards Skaia, which indicates that I kind of overthought this). I'm actually pretty fond of how the tiny Beat Mesa and Prospit's moon turned out.\nOh yeah, the song itself is also SUPER pretty (I'm surprised I managed to snag such a lovely song to make art for), but you'll know that already considering you're probably listening to it right now.",

Quiet save for birds, barking dogs, and the subtle but constant drone of faraway highway noise, it’s a beautiful and peaceful place to live. Unfortunately, life in Ashburn can get a bit dull after high school: Friends leave for college and there’s no easy public transportation to the hour-away city, so there’s not much to do outside the house except take walks through the scenic woods and hillsides. If you’re not the outdoorsy type (and especially if you work from home), a reclusive life can be easy to fall into. With this song I intend to convey the strange dichotomy between the semi-natural beauty of Ashburn’s ample wooded landscape and carefully maintained lawns, and the ever-present plasticity that permeates both the town and my necessarily internet-centric lifestyle.",

Anyway, it's a song about being at home, and also not being at home, at the same time, at all times, and also, places.

Still in our stage costumes we opened our cans of Dr. B and casually sat around his bedroom. Computers were turned on, subwoofers were turned up. And so it began that we started remixing.\nNearly two months later we sat in the back of a van amongst instruments and gear on our way to play another concert, this time at a Houston anime convention. Computers were turned on, headphones were turned up. It was here that Crystalmethequins, begun so many weeks earlier, was finally completed.\nAfter deciding that the track art would not be a hastily photoshopped image of troll Bryan Cranston, I came to someone I trusted. Richard Gung is unarguably the master, and his track art was well worth the cost he took from me in that dark alley.\nThe song was chosen from among its peers to open Volume 9. There it stands proudly to this day.",

        "commentary": "<i>Malcolm Brown:</i>\n<code style=\"color: #e00707\">DAVE: we are in the shit now<br>DAVE: we are motherfuckin entrenched in this bitch</code>\nThat’s right! It’s time to talk about Anbroids 2.0! Hands up everyone who thought “Brobots” would’ve been a better name? Yeah that’s what I thought… Still! Here we are so let’s commence the proceedings:\n<b>THE CONCEPT</b>\nSo much of the inspiration here comes directly from Davesprite, which I remember thinking “Oh god damn if that Yamaha YM2612 Genesis/Mega Driveness doesn’t fit Dave quite well!”.  Enter Dirk Strider and his robotic creations! Suddenly a synthy, retro chiptune doesn’t sound so out of place.\nMy idea was formed fairly early on after we’d learned a bit of his pastime.  I came up with the idea of having a kind of “Workshop” theme where Dirk would put some music on and get to work constructing some brobot or other.  From here there was a number of prerequisites:\n<ol><li>Must be kinda funky. Dude’s a Strider after all. So we’re looking at a bit of a groove with the beat.</li> <li>Must have square waves, which is sort of the national instrument of Robonia.</li> <li>Solos!</li></ol>\nAll this in mind, I nabbed a general purpose Genesis soundfont (Which seems to be comprised of voices mainly nabbed from Sonic, certainly the percussion is - You should be able to recognize the snare from the opening riff of Sonic the Hedgehog). And got to work.\n<b>NAME</b>\nYeah, so I thought “Brobots” would’ve been a better name, especially because that became their canon name in the comic, but by then Hussie had used it in the comic under the name Anbroids, so it stuck :p I apended a 2.0 on it because the versions became fairly different.  I also figured some people might want the original version 1.0 used in the comic after the album came out.\nSpeaking of which...\n<b>VERSION ONE</b>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICTFBDONdI\">[LISTEN TO] IT HERE!</a>\nThis was an in progress version that Hussie nabbed early on before I’d made changes to create the newer version.  I’ll go into why it changed in a bit, but here’s a good place to discuss the track at large:\nThe main theme is there, but a bit… “Lazier” - It doesn’t have a lot of the swing it’d later develop.  It also opens with just a percussive riff, which is probably most influenced by the likes of Toejam ‘n Earl.  Overall I reckon this version lacked energy, so it needed a bit of a rework before I reckoned it was cool enough to be a Strider song…\n<b>VERSION TWO</b>\nThe percussive intro was removed in favor of a “Booting up” thing (Just a pitch bended squave), followed by a not-so-subtle parody of the original Game Boy bootup noise.  The main “guitar” riff came back with a bit of stereo (Which I tried to use a bit more of).\nAt 0:23 we jump into the first of various solos. One of the tricky parts of chiptune music is, yes you have limited channels, voices and often no polyphony (multiple notes on the same track at the same time) so if you want to make it sound realistically retro you need to abide by these laws, but that doesn’t mean you can’t play with pitch, modulation, stereo etc - The solos were effectively a lesson in mucking about with these to create something that sounded fairly dynamic for a sequenced solo.\nAt 0:40, just before the main melody kicks in, we have the first “boot error” sound - Just a flat bass note on the square.  There’s one at the end as well - The main concept was while he’s building these brobots, occasionally something’ll go wrong - It’ll fail to start or it’ll start going haywire - and so he has to unplug and start again trying something else.\n0:43 has the main melody.  It’s similar to the original Version 1 but it’s been funked up a bit - Mainly to avoid it sounded like other stuff (I’m looking at you, Lady Gaga’s Alejandro). Again, bit of pitch wobbliness to give an air of a kind of hectic, technological mess.\nThe second solo changes the key, and here the idea is Dirk’s moved on to working on something else.  As the solo continues, it gets more and more hectic until it’s just splattering notes everywhere, like the brobot’s gone completely off the rails and it’s flailing around the room - At 1:35 it’s promptly shutdown and we bridge back into the main melody again (This bridge was removed from V1, but brought back in by, well, Rad’s request :p I liked it too though, has a Sonic-y feel to it).\nBit of harmonizing later (partially indicating that the Brobot Dirk’s working on has started to play ball and is synchronizing with his personality). One last “Perfected” solo (1:58) which is actually a modified version of the original solo that’s basically a lot “wilder”, to show we’ve finally perfected the upgrade and ready to ship.\nSo with that, everything’s shut down, and the song ends.\nGranted, I probably didn’t manage to get this little ‘story’ across with everybody, but this was the general thought process when I was making the thing.  Hopefully if you listen to it now you’ll get some of the ideas I was going for. If not? Well… enjoy it however you like :p Or even come up with your own interpretation that’s better than mine :p\nJohnathan Griffiths was the track art man of the hour - There’s even a mega drive controller there! And how are those shades staying on? All round awesome :)",

        "commentary": "<i>Malcolm Brown:</i>\nAaah Pumpkin Party in Sea Hitler’s Water Apocalypse. Or Pumpkin Party in Colony 413 or whatever I was calling it before I decided to go nuts.  The original working title was just “Pumpkin Party”, so at the very least we started somewhere sensible.\nSo let’s have a chat about where this one came from.\n<b>THE CONCEPT</b>\nSo around about <a href=\"https://www.homestuck.com/story/4852\">THIS PANEL</a> during Dirk’s history lesson of the future, we got a glimpse as to what Roxy was up to - Helping the locals out in the post apocalyptic hell-future.  Some bizarre idea came about that herself and the Carapacians would get together and have a little underground party away from the watchful gaze of the Condensce and her drones and the like.  Gotta find some way to keep your spirits up, right? So with that incredibly vague concept the idea was born to come up with some small light of goodness and happiness in, well, “Sea Hitler’s Water Apocalypse”.\n<b>THE NAME</b>\nAs mentioned this changed a few times, but this line sums up pretty much everything you need to know about the future:\n<code style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Like what is even your day to day business like in sea hitlers water apocalypse??</code>\n<b>THE TRACK</b>\nAs I recall, with this one it was mainly the instruments chosen that defined it.  The Banjo just struck the right kind of sound, and from there an accordion to give it a bit of a polka feel.  A lot of the crafting of this one was trying desperately not to have it ending up too much like the Ievan Polkka (Which thanks to a month of Project Diva on PSP is firmly embedded in my brain…).\nThe idea of mixing Chiptune samples and real instruments is something I was playing with a lot this album (Encore does it as well, as did the dropped ‘Mother’) - I felt this was a kind of neat “This is where we were, and this is where we are now” concept.  HS is still about a game, and it’s neat to embed some of the more obvious gamey elements now and then.  Plus it might just be me, but accordions and square waves go really well together :D\nThe “Ooh!” “Ahh!” chants were added just to give it a bit more of a folk appeal, and the air-raid sirens were added last to build up the scene of this party going on while the world’s gone to hell outside - perhaps some other colony’s getting obliterated for whatever reason.  Either way, it bookends the song quite nicely, coming back now and then and returning at the end to signify the dance is over.\nMy favorite bit of the whole thing is the solo at 1:56 - It’s just so gosh darn happy!\nOverall though? It’s a bit of a zany, dance-party track.  Completely juxtapositions the hell-nightmare outside, and in the end that’s the point!  Of course things get worse, but “Red Miles In Sea Hitler’s Water Apocalypse” will have to wait…\nDamn, I just realized I should’ve added some meows.  I’ve got like two cats sitting here ready for a vocal performance as well… Ah well, the road not taken.\nOnce again the art is very spiffy so many thanks to Marina! Look at that dude in the corner? That pumpkin is so nom’d! :D",

        "commentary": "<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>\nBefore this track was used in Homestuck along with Beatfox’s “A Taste for Adventure”, it was actually made for a nearly 3-year-old defunct fan project. Housetrapped was a story about an alternate Sburb session and “Another Jungle” was a the-same-but-different theme for the loading screen of that universe’s Sburb client. Sound familiar?\nWhen we shifted into gear to create new Homestuck music following the start of Act 6, I was asked to refurbish the forgotten 40-second theme I’d written as the theme to Sburb Alpha. “Another Jungle” is thus the alpha equivalent of “Sburban Jungle” which I had written back when Homestuck began - structurally both songs are very similar, but each with their own melodies and sound choices.\n“Another Jungle” has the benefit of years of experience with production I did not have when Homestuck began, and to me the fidelity difference really shows. Since writing “Sburban Jungle” I’d become far more familiar with automation, recording, eq, mixing, mastering, and all the techniques that polish a music project. “Another Jungle” is far more dynamic than its predecessor, with each subsequent section of the song having its own unique way of using the instruments and sounds in the project.\nMy favorite touches to this one are all the very mellow sounds that contrast with the brisk pacing of the track - the various pads, the wah-wah guitar, the echoing melody, all of it underlined by drums and brute synth loops. The sudden change in energy when the guitars duck out in the middle and the melody of “Showtime” whispers in is a favorite moment of mine. The very pop ending with its retro house sound was another choice I wouldn’t have seen myself making three years back. Hope you enjoy this one as much as I do.\nThe art for this track is by Richard Gung.",

        "commentary": "<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>\nOriginally we’d planned on doing a Homestuck album that was devoted entirely to the Sburb Alpha kids and their session, all of us doing tracks that would parallel earlier tracks in a same-but-different fashion. While this album became Homestuck Vol. 9, a lot of analogous tracks remained from the original concept, including this track as an alternative to “GameBro (Original 1990 Mix)” from Homestuck Vol. 6: Heir Transparent.\nWhile we can only imagine what the set-decorating GameGrl magazine from Jane Crocker’s bedroom might actually be like, it’s pretty easy for me as a child of the 90’s to imagine how the magazine might have looked in the era of the Burger King Kid’s Club and Lisa Frank. With GameGrl I attempted to capture a lot of the basic messages perpetuated to girls by children’s advertising in the 90’s:\n<ul><li>Boys are gross and need to have their butts kicked</li> <li>Girls are cool and should pretend to understand pop culture</li> <li>Clubs must be started in tree-houses and couch forts to keep boys out</li> <li>Parents suck and will never understand</li> <li>You can trust corporate America</li></ul>\nThe music was a hodge-podge of a lot of things - the production style of early 90’s house music (Deee-Lite and Cathy Dennis were my main references) was coupled with the intentionally insipid rap vocals in a time in which many game commercials <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkWYP95WbbY\">had</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__j99flW9w\">awful</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7FN5B02YEo\">raps</a>. The lead vocals are performed by Tavia Morra, whose voice I discovered sounds scarily childlike when sped up slightly. We played the backup track at about 75% speed and had her rap over it to create the vocal comp before speeding it back up to create the cringe-worthy little girl voice. I did a digital process to lower my voice to create the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0LoHA_FPAs\">Pokérap</a>-style breakdown towards the middle of the track and then asked Erik Scheele to play a painfully retro midi guitar solo.\nFor the track art (lovingly created and posed for by Tavia) among our many references were Alex Mack and The Olson Twins. The big deal-breaker for us was getting a pair of overalls, a garment seemingly synonymous with the 90’s. We spent nearly three hours hunting for a pair in Austin coming up short at Wal-Mart, Academy, Sheplers, Cavender’s Boot City, Goodwill, a costume store, a paint store, and a plumbing store before finally finding a wearable piece 17 miles out of town at a farm supply store. Apparently humanity had the good sense to wipe that fucking hideous fashion travesty off the face of the earth at the end of the decade (I knew the y2k bug must have done something!) and now only people who actually need them wear them.\nWe took our pictures at the Japanese-style game center Arcade UFO. Outtakes can be found <a href=\"https://seeyoutmorra.tumblr.com/post/24983253249/some-of-the-other-photos-from-the-gamegrl\">here</a>.\n<i>Tavia Morra:</i>\nI don’t even know where to start.\nOne day Bowman and I discovered that if we pitched my voice up a little higher than where it normally is, then I sounded like a 12 year old girl. The idea for GameGrl came up later and he proceeded to write lyrics that would make any 90’s kiddo cringe at the nostalgia of their childhood and want to do it again.\nI had way too much fun recording it to the point that I knocked over a music stand from dancing too much. Bowman was a fantastic coach. It’s always a pleasure to work with him.\nThe track art has more of a story to it than I would have cared for, but Bowman and I both knew we had to go all the way with the track art. And so begun our quest for the GameGrl outfit, which we found all of the clothing elements for except for the overalls.\nWe figured we were just going to go around the corner to the Goodwill, find a pair of overalls, slap those suckers on and get the track art done within about an hour tops.\nBut no.\nNo, no, no.\nWe ended up shopping for three hours at nine separate stores before we found those goddamn overalls. Bowman livetweeted our journey:\n<img src=\"media/misc/overall-quest.jpg\" width=\"331\" height=\"799\">\nEventually we got the overalls and proceeded to take the most fantastic pictures ever. I’ll be posting up some other photos from that day later on so keep your eyes peeled!",

Examples include cities, mountains, buildings, individual rooms, even entire planets (see [[album:Medium]]).\nAustin is currently my real world home, and to imagine it flooded and empty is a fascinating thing. Should Dirk ever decide to explore beyond Houston, what forgotten worlds would he find in the other lost Texan fortresses?\nThe whole song was written to musically explore this sunken Austin, and to deliver a strong atmosphere and sense of place. The parts I used to piece together this portrait are the constituent Homestuck tunes, each of which I chose because of thematic applicability; they include Beatdown, Explore, Flare, and even Atomyk Ebonpyre.\nTo capture the same essence visually in the track art, I knew I could trust Tynic. She is an incredible background artist with an uncanny sense for colors and composition! I am so proud of her work here; the song just wouldn’t be the same without the accompanying artwork.\nAdditional fun fact: the entire song is played off key, detuned into the spaces between quartertones. The piano itself is significantly flat. This surprised me in how far it went toward making the song sound “sunken.”",

        "commentary": "<i>Toby Fox:</i>\nart by P-RO at <a href=\"https://nomorepros.tumblr.com\">nomorepros.tumblr.com</a>. P-RO always does a maximally amazing job so why I asked her to draw the art is a non-question.\nStress is actually a pretty faithful arrangement of an original track by Buzinkai. Buzinkai has been responsible for several HS-important melodies like Doctor, Endless Climb, and Explore and [her] work, for me, has always established a certain “essence” of what Homestuck is. My goal for this piece was actually to create a classic strife theme for Dirk with the core feeling of earlier pieces like Showtime or Doctor, so basing the piece off of something with that “essence” was important.*\nI can’t say why Buzinkai wrote this piece the way she did, so I’ll instead highlight the differences between the original and my arrangement.\n<ul><li><p>Updated the instrumentation. Buzinkai’s usage of PXTONE is indeed charming and nostalgic-sounding, but I wanted to push things bit further. One major difference is the arrangement of the strings - Buzinkai’s PXTONE strings have an sharp attack to them, while mine come on a bit softer but are thicker. My strings then sound more “lush” but less “urgent.”</p></li> <li><p>I added a section between the original A section and B section with lower intensity. This was because the song got a bit too repetitive and static simply repeating like Buzinkai’s. Oddly, the repeats didn’t bother me in his track. I think this is partially because MY loop point, unlike Buzinkai’s, lowers the intensity a LOT more by removing a bunch of instruments where his simply flows into a repeat. I need to think about that more.</p></li> <li><p>Added an introduction and a true ending to make it more of a proper start-to-finish song.</p></li></ul>\nAbout the similarity to Teal Hunter and a fun syncopation lesson:\n<ul><li>This was unintentional - I not only started my arrangement of this song before the contest was conceived, Buzinkai made the original song back in 2010. THOUGH as soon as I heard Teal Hunter I KNEW people would call out the similarities because, surprise, there are plenty of them! Here’s the big one:</li> <li><p>Both pieces are in 5/4 (5 beats per measure, try counting to 5 over and over on the beat) and use the SAME syncopation (syncopation = the division of notes into smaller off-beat rhythms within the measure) throughout the track. Actually, many many many pieces in 5/4 use this syncopation. See: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nlCNVewMjA\">Hollow Bastion</a>. Why do composers keep doing this? Two reasons: One, because it sounds awesome. Second, because the main way to compose in odd time signatures like 5/4 or 13/4** is actually to cut things into smaller units of 3, 2, or 4. Though each measure is comprised of 5 total beats, each measure in these songs is cut into 10 notes of half the length going 123-123-12-12. 3! 3! 2! 2!</p> <p>Wow, that was a very poor explanation. But please go to that Hollow Bastion video I linked and count “one-two-three-one-two-three-one-two-one-two” very quickly along with each note the harp plays. You’ll get it. (And I’m just making things more confusing, but isn’t it awesome how the syncopation switches at the end of the  4-measure phrase to “1234 12 12 12?” The little bit of contrast makes it feel complete.)</p> <p>So, why don’t people just cut things up differently? like 3 2 2 3? it’s definitely possible! Here’s my theory about why people favor the syncopation they do: It seems like ending a measure with a shorter note ON the beat leads into the next measure more naturally. It even sounds like a leadin: dun-DUN! This is supported by the fact that one of the most popular syncopations in existence is the one in 4/4 that goes 3 3 2. This is probably the same principle.</p> <p>3 3 2: ON OFF ON<br>3 3 2 2: ON OFF ON ON</p></li> <li><p>Besides the fact that the syncopation is identical, the chords and melody are similar and the way the strings are used are basically the same. I have no explanation for this other than… great minds think alike???</p> <p>RANDOM FUN FACT: Awakening is also in 5/4, go to 1:40 and sing the melody to Stress. Hell, <a href=\"media/misc/stresscombo.mp3\">I’ll do it for you.</a> It fits!!! The main melody of awakening also starts with a similar rhythm as Stress. it’s the curse of the 123 123 12 12’s.</p></li></ul>\nWow, I really got off track here. But I hope you learned something today.\n* Yes, Bill Bolin also started an arrangement of this piece before he left the team. I think we were both attracted to the same “essence” present in Buzinkai’s piece.\n** Bonus challenge: See if you can count out how I divided the measures in this song! If you can do this, you can easily understand how to compose in time signatures like this. It’s actually VERY simple and derived directly from the other breakdowns I did.",

        "commentary": "<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>\nI get the feeling that down the line there will be an explanation for why exactly there’s a tiny Maplehoof on Dirk Strider’s desk and it will be one of the biggest plot revelations in all of Homestuck. For me it was a cue that there needed to be a Sburb Alpha universe parallel for the song [[track:maplehoofs-adventure]], which in itself was a spiritual sequel to [[track:pony-chorale]]. It’s sort of a reality check to realize that I have written not one, not two, but three songs for cartoon ponies now - I guess that’s part of this disease we call the Internet.\nAs with the previous installments, I used a sample of Tavia Morra saying “neigh” to punctuate phrases, this time sped up to about double speed to have that chipmunk-esque effect. Everything about this song is a bit faster-paced and squeakier to reflect the stature of the tiny horse. The orchestration was largely inspired by my last trip to Disneyland - the whistles are arranged to sound a bit like the teapots from Alice in Wonderland, and the horn synths were selected because of their resemblance to a merry-go-round organ.\nAlong with recent tracks like [[track:another-jungle]] and [[track:elephant-gun]], this song represents one of my attempts to stick less closely to a predictable song form. The key signature moves up a whole step around 32 seconds in and never comes back down, and the main repeated refrain that ties the song together is the little cadence that shows up at the end of each section. I stuck to my guns as a high school music theory student on this one, mostly drawing from Mozart and Sousa - it’s an overstimulating mess of counterpoint, and my main goal was to see if it would annoy composition major Erik Scheele (it worked).\nOut of all the tracks for Volume 9 I worked on, this one was a real breeze. I was on such a roll that I considered making it ten minutes long just to piss off everyone, but I knew that I’d most likely be asked to cut it down if I’d gone to that kind of excess, and I had other tracks to work on.\nThe track art was done by Tavia Morra.\n<i>Tavia Morra:</i>\nBowman and I quickly settled on the idea of a picture emphasizing the size of Minihoof, but couldn’t decide on a specific way to show it. Maybe put a magnifying glass over the little pony? Having her next to Dirk’s hand while he typed on the computer? The energy of the track made us think of little Minihoof running through an obstacle course Dirk set up for her on his desk, thus the stapler, the tacks, the brads, the pencils, and the GameBro Magazines. This was a super fun one for me since I had such a personal investment in it.",

        "commentary": "<i>Malcolm Brown:</i>\nLet’s talk about Encore! Or “Showtime 2: Encore”.\n<b>THE CONCEPT.</b>\nSo back in the early days of Volume 9, the idea was “The New Session”.  The further idea was to take the tracks ‘n themes of Volume 1/Act 1 and ‘re-scratch’ em to come up with a parallel for the new session and the new kids.  Where this idea started to fall to bits was expecting the act to play similarly to Act 1, which it quickly didn’t :)\nStill, by this point we had a decent collision of re imagined classic tracks and Strife/character themes for the new kids, so on with the show.\nEncore was a straight-up “Let’s bring Showtime kicking and screaming into the new session, but a little bit mixed, yet still recognizable”.\n<b>THE NAME.</b>\nShould be obvious. “Showtime” -> “Encore”.\n<b>THE TRACK.</b>\nMaking Showtime orchestral wasn’t too hard.  The idea of a very pomp-y, brass, adventure-y/combat affair was formed fairly early on - I think the main channeling came from a Power Stone/Smash Brothers-esque “Zany combat” idea.\nMost of the voices come from EWQL’s Symphonic Orchestra, with a bit of soundfonts for the later Showtime segment.\nThe section at 0:22 has a bit of history - It was originally a straight up Lifdoff arrangement, but I pulled it back and made it considerably less obvious (I’ve became hesitant of Lifdoff since someone pointed out it sounds like the Bruce Lee story theme :p) - I *did* leave the little brass phrases that punctuated it, which unintentionally/subconsciously might be referencing Earthsea Borealis.  This wasn’t intended, but it’s probably close enough for it not just to be a coincidence, and enough people seem to be picking up on this accidental reference so what the hell :p\nNext it returns to the alternate Showtime and adds on Unite Synchronization.  Does a floaty little bridge afterwards, and then we get into the original Showtime.\nI pondered adding this for a while, since it felt a bit “Yes, we get it, this is a Showtime thing, y’don’t need to actually add the thing in”, but eventually I liked the idea of it smashing in, completely brazen with its NES-y soundfont and blaring the original track in the last section of the song.  We then wind down with the fast-paced percussion and the starting brass arrangement, just enough time for a post-battle ass-kicking pose, and then “Boom”.\nI think writing tracks for characters like John/Jake’s quite fun in that they’ve got this bottomless optimism and carefree attitude, plus they do silly things. Silly things are quite fun to score...\nAnd that’s Encore! Hope ya’ll enjoyed that little trip back down memory lane!",

        "commentary": "<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>\nThis is pure Jake strife music - I started this project with the definite goal in mind to make something that sounded purely like video game music for a battle. Jake English is sort of the archetypal Roosevelt-type swashbuckler with all the bravado of a turn-of-the-century primitivist. For him, the palette of sounds is instantaneous: heavy percussion rumbling at a breakneck pace. I threw in chimes, timpani, xylophone, glockenspiel, cymbal crashes, and an uncompromising drum machine to get the atmosphere I wanted.\nI had a nice, retro-sounding portamento synth as a lead, a quick little intro, and a couple of smart little themes going on right at the beginning, and I was all set for this to be one of those simple, memorable themes not unlike one of the previous Strife themes (“Beatdown”, “Showtime”). Then, at 44 seconds in, something snapped - I suddenly decided that what I was writing was boring and that nothing could be normal from that point on. Inspired by a few listens to “Rollo Interior”, I wrote a rhythmically unconventional breakdown followed by the whole song shifting into “Zappa chords” for a little while.\nWhat was excellent about working on this track is it’s one of the first instances in a while where I had really freed myself from any preconceived goals for the song’s form and just decided to write a track from start to finish and see what felt right. I ended up at sort of the golden length - the song begins to loop at 2:15, making it still functional as video game music, and fades out by 2:39. Tavia pointed out to me that pop songs that run a bit short of 3 minutes tend to be incredibly satisfying, especially for a first time listener, as they ask for your attention for an amount of time that doesn’t wear you down. Out of all my tracks for Vol. 9, this is the one I find the easiest to listen to on a loop.\nThe track art is by 8bitkitten.",

We sent Jane Dargason back and forth between us, remixing each other’s remixes until the track was in its final state. For reference:\nThe original sketch put together by RJ sounded like <a href=\"media/misc/jane-dargason-sketch.mp3\">this</a>.\nBy the end of the process, things had evolved <a href=\"https://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/jane-dargason-2\">quite a bit</a>.\nI also want to take a moment to say that my good friend Dawn did a spectacular job on the track art! She has a wondrous way with colors, and her drawings of the Homestuck kids have a childlike optimism about them. Nothing could have been a more perfect match for a track like this one!\n(<a href=\"https://plazmataz.tumblr.com/post/23084666959/and-for-your-listening-pleasure-a-snippet-of\">Tumblr</a>)\nAnd for your listening pleasure, <a href=\"media/misc/jane-dargason-another-sketch.mp3\">a snippet</a> of something called Jane Dargason. It is an unfinished track, part of my work lately putting together some music for Homestuck Volume 9. <a href=\"album/homestuck-vol-9/princess-of-helium.jpg\">The beautiful artwork</a>, for which the music is arguably just a vehicle, is brought to you by the astounding talent of Tavia Morra.\nYou remember [[Jade Dragon]], right? The rich wall of sound therein owes itself to the fact that it samples Viva la Vida, from its namesake Coldplay album. Jane Dargason is a spiritual successor, using samplework from Life in Technicolor off the same album. All of this is combined here to surprisingly lovely effect with sounds from an unreleased track by RJ (who, as we have discussed, is the coolest).\nIn short, we have an anthemic Jane tune in the workings!\n<i>Quasar Nebula:</i>\nthe track art attached to the audio file on the original tumblr post eventually became the art for [[Princess of Helium]]!",

        "commentary": "<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>\nThis track was an attempt to try something in the same vain as the soundtrack to Jet Set Radio Future which was recommended to me by friends Erik Scheele and Richard Gung. Composer Hideki Naganuma has created some of the most intricate and engaging pieces of dance music I’ve ever heard - his signature approach is his construction of entire songs around only a handful of samples (check out “Funky Dealer” for a good example).\nGoing off of the notion that there aught to be some music dedicated to the 3 years that John, Jade, and Davesprite spend by killing time in Ghostbusters 2 MMORPG, I recorded myself singing the famous exclamation uttered by Ray Parker Jr partway through the legendary 1984 single. What is the deal with that line, really? Apparently chasing ghosts isn’t just a public service for Mr. Parker - it gets him off.\nThe majority of the track is driven by drum and crowd samples with some very funky but intentionally primitive synths on top. I liked the idea of building up to some big climactic house beat, and the climax of the song is sort of an homage to Kalibration and his EDM project Screamcatcher (albeit missing all the cool).\nThe art is by Victoria Grace Elliott.",

When Tavrisprite appeared in the comic, I challenged myself to make a suitable theme at the same pace I might once have cobbled something together back in 2009. I posted the resulting demo track on my Soundcloud the same day as the character made its debut.\nMy demo fused the Spanish sounds associated with Tavros and the electric lead guitar associated with Vriska. The result was just over a minute of power-flamenco silliness which I planned to expand upon heavily until suddenly Tavrisprite exploded less than an hour after I uploaded the demo. I decided the song aught to be short and sweet as well, so I asked Thomas Ferkol to play some additional metal guitar at the end before dropping in an explosion effect and a distantly echoing “honk” from a certain codpiece-wearing merchant.\nThe track art is by 8bitkitten.",

The Midnight Crew, while fashion-savvy, are cold-blooded murderers, and I’d been curious as to what a darker version of their signature song might sound like.\nThe inspiration for this “post-punk” arrangement comes specifically from the Iggy Pop track “Nightclubbing”, which was produced by David Bowie during their stay in Berlin in 1977. The Iggy Pop and Eddie Morton tracks are very different takes on a night on the town, and I was utterly fascinated by the thought of injecting the old ragtime track with the same seedy atmosphere of Iggy’s sardonic croon.\nI’d been playing this particular arrangement live at live shows for a while, and for this recorded version I brought in bandmates Erik Scheele and Marcy Nabors to record their respective parts. Erik delivers the excellent jazz piano, while Marcy added some amazing textures by playing theremin and accordion. I made full use of the wah pedal on my guitar to deliver the very textured guitar performance, and copied Iggy’s beloved drum machine loop for the main percussion.\nThe track art is by Cari Garafalo.",

Though, having a good instinct for interesting rhythms definitely is why I seem to be so notorious for percussion/drum beats.\nThat said, Portrait is a funny case in particular, and its weirdness is quite a bit more deliberate than the other two, simply because I was more experienced by the time of its release.\nThe song is in mixed meter. Now, you certainly can hash it out to 14/4 and be happy with it, because it works out that way, but the song is actually written in alternating measures of 15/8 and 13/8. Or was it 13/8 and 15/8? It’s been awhile. Either way, the song itself never sits still and shifts its pulse back and forth the entire way, and ends up making the later breakbeat/drum and bass part all the more crazy.\nAnd yet it still seemed to work!\nAs for everything since Portrait, any weird percussion I do has been completely deliberate and thought out, because, as I said before, I understand my instincts on it. More importantly, I understand why those instincts work.\nTL;DR; In a past life, I was probably a drummer.\n:D",

        "commentary": "<i>James Dever:</i>\n<b>History</b>\nIgor Stravinsky has been a gigantic inspiration for me for a long time. My favorite piece of all time is his Firebird Suite, and not far behind is his other ballet the Rite of Spring. The latter is the main inspiration behind this track!\nI listened to the Rite of Spring quite a bit throughout last year and I really was compelled to write something inspired by it. When the End of Act 5 flash came out, Andrew also revealed the now memetic Red Miles attack. I thought of no better way to elude to two of my favorite things than combining them this way! I set out on the concept of making a Rite of Spring-esque movement to fit the devastating attack.\n<b>The Music</b>\nThe direct segment I was trying to parallel is thesecond section. Staccato unbowed strings playing eighth notes on a single chord with an accent pattern. The difference here is that as crazy as that segment may get, Stravinsky wrote the whole thing in 2/4. Red Miles I just had fun and it alternates between 2/4, 7/8, 5/8 and whatever the hell I felt like/8. I had a whole lot of fun with time signatures is what I mean.\nThe accent pattern I use has a bit of history behind it as well. I’m a band geek if no one had noticed yet, and was heavily into marching band during high school. Being a percussionist, I kind of had a love/hate relationship with drumline warmups. One in particular we played waaaaay too much was the accent to tap exercise. For people who don’t know too much about drumline, it’s just an exercise that warms up the extremes of playing. Most notes are steady pulse beats but then an accent pattern is introduced to differentiate height, sound and velocity between taps (normal strokes) and accents. Ours was called “Cinco de Mayo” because it was mostly in 5/8. I took the same pulse (12 123 12 123 123 12 123 12 12 - accents on 1) and applied it to the strings.\nI tried to fully orchestrate it, so the next section introduces an English Horn (oh man english horn I could go on for days about) and a bassoon (also could go on forever fuck yeah double reeds) trading off a little melody between accent patterns akin to Rite of Spring. Then I gave the accent to two timpani (yeah the piece would require two timpanist or an inhuman player) because it’s my favorite instrument and I don’t incorporate enough percussion into my pieces for a percussionist. The next section introduces the first real theme. I originally wrote these melodies messing around with four mallets on a marimba. I was intending on making something primitive like RoS (hence unmoving bassline) and then translated it to piano then full score. It alternates between d minor and D Major just by tweaking around with the F sharp. Fun stuff.\nSamm Neiland influenced me in two ways in this piece. The first being the continuation of the accent pattern through the middle sections. I personally really enjoy the piece more because of it. It makes it really interesting because it brings so many different time signatures against each other. The melody is sporadically flipping between 7/8 and 2/4 while the accent pattern is mostly in 5/8. They don’t quite match up either but I fix the problem with a few filler measures with the pulse.\nAfter the middle themes are presented it returns back to the beginning with just the solid accent pattern and the return of the simple trading melody (this time with oboe and bass clarinet). The timpani returns triumphantly afterwards. This time, however, I change it up by immediately jumping back into the strings having the pattern. At this point, the brass and woodwinds are given simple versions of the accent pattern. They all come in at different times creating a really uneven spread. Eventually the upper lines start to contort the line and break into competing dotted rhythms to give a feel of chase. It builds more and more through the ending section up until a sudden cut off.\nThe final addition by Samm was the diminuendo final chord to ease the listener out of the piece!\n<b>Concept</b>\nAs stated earlier, the whole concept is suppose to be giving the terrible fear inducing attack “Red Miles” a soundtrack. The attack is devastating and annihilates all in its way. As we all have heard countless times: you can’t escape the miles. Originally, there was to be a whole lot more to the piece (multiple movements!). I didn’t have anything else in other movements concrete at the time for finalization of Volume 9 so I released the abridged version you have now! Therefore, I like to think of this version as the Diamonds Droog version of the attack. Smaller scale but not any less deudley.\nI originally wanted to name it Red Miles (Abridged) but that ended up falling through. It sounds perfectly fine as is anyways. Eventually though, I would love to completely finish the whole work (I’m talking 5-6 movements, all inspired by RoS).\nThe last section that I described as sounding almost like a chase is purposeful. The concept is that Diamond Droog is releasing the miles upon the universe and the different musical sections are the different scenes of destruction. The final scene where everything becomes hectic is suppose to be Dirk flying through crumbling towers and crazy red death tentacles trying to escape a painful death. The sudden cut off was suppose to be kind of a cliffhanger like “where did he go???” but then the final resolution was supposed to sound similar to a big sigh of relief as he narrowly avoids doom.\n<b>Art!</b>\nOriginally, the art was to be done by everyone’s favorite person. Because of silly reasons (really silly, the silliest) it didn’t end up happening though. I freaking loved the art too. Instead though, we have a panel from the comic. It just so happens to be the panel where the miles are about to wreck shit at the abode of my favorite Alpha character. I didn’t know this at the time otherwise I’d never make a reference to such a horrible event :P",

        "commentary": "<i>Clark Powell:</i>\nBack on Volume 8 I wrote a song called Serenade; the track art for it explains well what the song is about. In a great many ways it was an important song for me. For one, it was the first song I’ve ever written, by which I mean a short, lyrical work written in a structure including verses and choruses. On top of that the music and the melodies came unusually naturally to me, and it all felt organic and expressive of my situation in life at the time of writing. Serenade is by far the closest emotional connection I have to Homestuck.\nNaturally I wanted to do things properly if I was going to revisit a tune so personally significant. As part of a larger project I was tentatively calling “cellostuck” I decided to tackle Serenade and record a version with live cello parts, hopefully bringing rich textures and lyricism to the song to reflect the musical and personal progress I had made since writing the original. It came out beautifully, much more so than the other experiments I had tried with other songs. I called the final mix Requited, implying that the song can be seen from the opposite side.\nConsider Requited the pre-Scratch counterpart to Serenade.\nFor the artwork on this track I asked my chum Dodostad to draw something up. Her style of whimsical, faded character art seemed the perfect match for the song, and she did a magnificent job.",

        "commentary": "<i>James Dever:</i>\n<b>History</b>\nThroughout the last year I’ve been more active on Skype with fellow Homestuck readers and contributors, especially since February when I was added to the (in?)famous Stupid O’ Clock chat. What I found out from a lot of them was that quite a lot more people enjoyed my first ever Homestuck track than I expected. Candles and Clockwork was actually pretty popular and multiple people came to me at different times saying I should work on it again with the better programs and talents I’ve acquired since.\nThe outcome was the remake I posted on my Tumblr a few days before the album came out. I posted this in the Volume 9 thread we had, and Albatross Soup offered to work on the track. The outcome is this final version of Candles and Clockwork!\n<b>The Music</b>\nI put a whole lot of subtle nuances into this piece. The biggest one being something that occurs throughout the piece and in almost every track of Sburb: hemiolas. For non-music folk, a hemiola is when a rhythm does not fit into the measure of music it is in. They are very similar and often function as polyrhythms, another favorite tactic of mine. In this track specifically, you can notice that the piano ostinato is clearly in 4/4. The clarinet and harp however, are in 3/4. Because of this, these lines only ever match up ever three measures for the piano and every four measures for the other instruments. Since the phrases don’t fit that pattern either, the actual lines never quite sync back up and repeat themselves. The melody line above it is for the most part in 4/4 but kind of sways the line between the two time signatures. This is also how I was able to adapt the melody into straight 3/4 for Chronicles (from Sburb) since that version does not have the 4/4 ostinato until the second section!\nFor this version, Albatross reorchestrated the parts and added his own distinct flare to the piece. The original version had a dulcimer and harp generating the two ostinati in an attempt to generate a similar feel to the Kingdom of Zeal theme Corridors of Time from the video game Chrono Trigger. The remake I made changed the dulcimer for a harpsichord to change up the timbre slightly. The biggest change was moving the melodies first instance to cello. Albatross took this concept and took it further! The harpsichord became a piano line reminiscent of Chronicles and Candles and Merry Gentlemen (a bonus track from the Holiday album). The harp stays, but the lower voice doubling the part now became a clarinet. A flute is added at the vocal breakdown midway through the piece and then takes over the cello for the recap of the main melody! The ending also became a general diminuendo much like the original! I absolutely adore his take on the song.\n<b>Concept</b>\nThe original song was written at first in an attempt to go along with Doctor and Endless Climb as a calm and atmospheric song aimed at being a land theme for Dave. At the time we knew him as a knight and WV’s painting showed his planet with a large gear and fire. I figured from this that his land would involve something knightly/fire based and something involving gears. From that I guessed it’d be the Land of Candles and Clockwork. Little did I know that Andrew was going to break the chain and pick a vastly different song with Atomyk Ebonpyre.\nEver since I’ve considered the song to be a Strider anthem. Dave and Dirk have a whole lot of songs about them, but all of them are either derivatives of his instrument (inspiring hip hop beats etc) or just really intense. They both are actually really chill and collected for the most part, so I liked the idea of them having a calm song.\nAs for this name in particular, it should be obvious that it’s the post scratch version of the song (so aimed more at Dirk and Alpha Dave). The working title was also Candles and Clockwork (with the a’s replaced with lower case alpha symbols). Sadly, it doesn’t really differentiate itself from the original. The symbols aren’t separate enough to make it easy to tell the two versions apart.\n<b>Art!</b>\nThe art was done by the fantastic Worthikids who I only just recently discovered! They actually made it a while ago for the original Volume 5 version. I messaged them about using it for this version. Go check them out!",

        "commentary": "<i>David Ellis:</i>\nThis tune got some pretty cool art from kendle bentley b! at electroluxx.tumblr.com. I don’t really know anything other than ‘wow, that’s really cool’.\nSo let’s talk about the track. I said a little bit about it when I posted it but I thought I’d expand a little.\nThe piece is written for the Alpha kids’ version of Jack Noir, in particular his attempted jailbreak. Unsurprisingly then every guitar stab is supposed to represent Jack stabbing something. In the original version there were actually more stabs at the start that got cut fairly late in the process because while more stabbing probably suits the character it made the intro feel too long.\nAs the tune is for a Jack I thought his piece should be based on the Black theme. I’d been thinking about doing a take on it for a while but hadn’t figured out how I would do it until the jailbreak scene started. At the same time I’d been struggling to write the verse for the Jane song (I have that bit now but I’m still working on the song) so taking a break from that to play a lot of angry distorted guitars also seemed like a good idea.\nThe guitar solo is really hard to play.\nOriginally it was just going to be a fairly loose guitar jam over the chords from Upward Movement but while that was a lot of fun for me to play it turned out it wasn’t that much fun to listen to so I figured it was going to need some more backings. This led to the inclusion of a number of themes from Descend building up and then a little interplay in the strings at the end. Unfortunately this meant a loose jam style solo wasn’t going to cut it anymore so I sat and wrote out the solo you hear now. I threw in a quintuplet and a 5:6 tuplet because apparently I hate writing things I can play.\nWhen it was all done I uploaded it, blogged it and then tried to sleep while my phone kept going off until I turned off alerts. I didn’t really expect anyone to pick it up but it surprised me by being the most popular thing I’ve ever posted by a long way (thanks Radiation!).\nThe next day I got a message from Radiation saying he’d like to include it on the album (which turned out to be volume 9). So I went back and tweaked the mix a bit (mainly turning down the gain on the guitars and bringing out the strings in the descend section) and sent him the final wav which is what’s on the album. I’m really grateful to be included on the album and I’m glad people seem to like the track.\nFun if somewhat nerdy fact: The power down sound that leads into the guitar solo section is actually the sound made when the Hammond organ is switched off while holding down the last chord. The tonewheels inside the organ that generate the pitches start to slow down before the amplifier cuts out so you can hear the pitch lower before the sound stops.\nAfter I posted Noirscape it got added to the tracklist for LOFAM2 and straightfacedgriff had actually started doing art for it before I had the chance to quietly let them know that it wasn’t going to be on the album. The art pretty much sums up the scene the music was meant to be describing at the start though (assuming jack has a few more knives up his sleeve for the other guards) so I thought I’d include it here.\n<img src=\"media/misc/noirscape.png\" width=\"776\" height=\"776\">",

When the concept of the record was changed, it was decided that this relatively short song would be included as a bonus when you purchase the full album.\nThe track art is by Emery Ferguson.",

But I had nothing but cheap stuff at the time, so I think this one suffers a lot. Personal regret aside, I composed this as an ode to John, so it features the themes from Showtime and Harlequin. I wanted something big and dramatic, so I went the semi-orchestral route, and completely transformed the context of the two melodies I used to suit the mood of the piece. In particular, Harlequin seems almost unrecognizable unless you're paying attention or have a good ear. I think its attempt to come off as big and noble is a little heavy-handed at times, but it would definitely be a fun one to come back to and update.",

It came about in a strange, almost fateful way, and I think the final product reflects that. It was the first thing that Radiation and I worked on together, and it was through Hardchorale that our friendship started. He approached me with a MIDI file he had made, intending it to be a sort of \"boss battle\" arrangement of Chorale for Jaspers in the style of Harleboss. He asked if I would be interested in producing it, since at the time he was just starting out and had no means to do so. I agreed, Chorale being one of my favorite Homestuck tunes. So I produced it in a DAW to make it sound \"good\", and relative to the MIDI file it sounded great, and we were both really happy with it. Radiation got Bowman to record some heavy metal meows, which he apparently almost got kicked out of his apartment for recording and claims to have video of, though I have yet to see it. Once I found out it was going to be on Vol. 5, I added a section to it (roughly the last third of the piece) and at the very end sneaked the Squiddles theme just because I could. I realize that was more of a narrative than a commentary, but it's the history behind this piece that I find fun to talk about more than the piece itself.",

This is the reason Jit has gone on the record as saying Crystamenthequins was intended to accompany Jade's island being destroyed/her entering her land (I'm pretty sure that's how he described it) was because of this song. It's actually a really simple tune, and I've wanted to expand on it for ages but never got around to it. The entire piece consists of the same simple chord progression, but it's a good, if played out, progression. That and the beautiful harmonies one is guaranteed to find with it is why I think this is one of my more popular songs. It's not as well-composed as I'd like it to be, but it is definitely catchy. And Radiation was responsible for the name, jokingly calling it \"crystalanthemums\" after I described it sound like a crystalline flower. I decided that was as good a name as any, and I've had the pleasure of infecting its two remixes with such silly-sounding titles.",

        "commentary": "<i>Solatrus:</i>\n<i>(original commentary)</i>\nMy Skaia remix was actually done before I joined the music team.  I had first made a remix of Doctor (which you can hear <a href=\"https://homestuckgaiden.bandcamp.com/track/doctor-deep-breeze-mix\">here</a>), which apparently really caught the attention of the team, in part thanks to Blueberry.\nAnyway, just as I do now, I streamed music pretty regularly back then, and I’d often times do some improvisational piano over the rest of the mix I made for Incipisphere. Of course, one of those improv sessions (though not a live one) is what made it into the final mix.\nUltimately, Radiation told me it would probably be a good idea to not release Incipisphere Mix anywhere, and then eventually I got a private message from Andrew saying he wanted a .wav of it.\nAnd the rest, I guess, is history?\nOh, and one more thing: AndrewNeo, the guy who runs skaia.net, named both my Doctor remix and my Skaia remix.\n<i>(commentary redux)</i>\nLet’s have a bit of history before we jump into things with this song.\n<b>A Bit of History</b>\nI’ve been writing music among the longest out of all of the team members (9 and a half years now), but definitely not the longest. However, I definitely have to say I’ve improved more over the past two years than the seven years before that just from working with so many talented people.\nBut the difference in improvement between then and now is a story for another day. Let’s zip right just before I joined the team. While Skaia (Incipisphere Mix) is my first official Homestuck song, Doctor (Deep Breeze Mix) is my first Homestuck-related song, which you can download <a href=\"https://homestuckgaiden.bandcamp.com/track/doctor-deep-breeze-mix\">here</a>.\nThe reason I’m mentioning my Doctor remix is because it very much helped put Incipisphere Mix on Volume 5. From what I was told, it turned a few heads on the team. Kind of hilarious to go back and look at the thread, because multiple of my chums posted just after I did and I wasn’t even aware of who they were at the time. Then again, I was still VERY new to the community at the time. My very first post on the MSPA Forums was of a WIP of my Doctor remix.\nBlueberry eventually put me in contact with Radiation, and I was told not to release my Skaia remix anywhere. That made me very curious! And then not too long after that (a few days, I think), I received a message from Andrew Hussie himself on the forums saying he wanted the lossless master of Incipisphere.\n“Oh snap! I’m a guest artist on Volume 5!” … And the following day I see a new subforum sitting there and I found out I was invited to join the team. Exciting times, indeed.\n<b>The Song Itself</b>\nNow, I’m sure people are wondering why I went with doing a remix of Skies of Skaia. Well, simply put, I really liked the chord progression, and I really enjoyed one of the remixes that was formerly in the discography. Because of both, I decided I wanted to do something with a bit of a heavier sound to it, but keeping consistent with the light and vibrant tone qualities.\nThe bassline and drums definitely helped give the song a much heavier feel than the original, showing an earlier example of what I feel has become my typical contrast in music. I very much enjoy contrasts in all art forms. Unexpected contrasts that are executed well just really made me happy. I can’t say I’m particularly happy with the bassline now, but back then that was pretty appropriate for my skill level, plus having an arpeggiating sound that I really used to do too much.\nOf course, the comments I see the most on this song are on the improvised piano part. Before I was on the team I started doing a regular broadcast on the skaia.net internet radio, and I’d improvise over this song pretty often back then. I eventually figured out a few parts that I wanted to keep consistent, and I did a bunch of takes to finally get to what you hear in the final song. Of course, MIDI never seems to record very accurately, and I’m not actually the greatest at piano (!!!), so I had to do some fine-tuning on the note timings to make them actually sound precise. But those really fast runs were definitely real, and, no, don’t ask me to play it again. I won’t be able to. It was a really good day for me.",

        "commentary": "<i>Erik Scheele:</i>\nI’ll never really know what happened to produce this. Not really, never. I wish I could remember if there was some thought process behind it, some sort of inspiration, but I really can’t remember any. Most likely, that was for the better.\nWhat I mean is, I used to do a lot of improvisation after theater classes, instead of practicing, while my mother would clean up the various classrooms that were used. There was never really any inspiration for things that I can remember, and they were just a lot of off-the-cuff experiments of a sort, I guess. Some probably turned out great, and there were probably more than a couple days where nothing happened. I can remember trying to emulate different video game soundtracks or bits from them, but that was never really a norm. The only thing I’d ever think regularly was how no one would ever actually hear the improvisation I was playing, and I was okay with that. This was before college, anyway.\nMy point is, improvisation rarely had a point, so it’s really impossible to nail down if there was any reason for playing Sarabande that night. The way it went about, I just played the piece, exactly how it was recorded, aside from one little mistake. Then I stopped, went “Okay yeah, that was good”, packed up, and left. A while later, I needed to play things for the composer concert, so I performed it from memory, and that’s where the recording came from.\nIt’s kind of gained a status among the fandom for being music for when John reads Jade’s letter, which I think is a rather good place for it to go. Although, I think I actually called it “Rooftop Waltz” at one point, for Rose/Dave shipping stuff, buuuuut I’m rather glad that the “purpose” and title is changed now. “Rooftop Waltz”, that’s such an awful cheesy love title, plus, the piece really is a sarabande. I mean literally, it fits the genre fairly well, plus my composition prof called it “a perfect sarabande”, so there we go.",

I went for a whimsical, dreamy feel with this one, expressed through the 3/4 meter, waltz patterns, Lydian mode, and ringing, bell-like timbres. There's not a lot going on in this one, though I think it's charming in a childlike way. It was the first piece I made upon my return to the music team (I was in it since the beginning, but never made anything worthwhile and left for a few months since I was starting my first year of college)\n<i>(extra comments in reply to a Tumblr question)</i>\nFor some reason waltzes, Lydian mode, harps, and bell-like timbres seemed like the most appropriate ways to evoke dreams for me. I was inspired to make it ever since seeing Jade’s dream self, and how appropriate that it was included in Dave’s dream in Derse!\nFor those not around since the beginning of that page or who don’t know the history, it was originally full of Bill Bolin tunes (a former music team member who left on very bad terms) and we had to replace them with existing material. One of the things Andrew put in there was Phantasmagoric Waltz, and now that page has the additional comedy of Dave and Rose jamming out to...a sweet, slow-paced romantic dance? I can dig it.\nFor the record, that’s not a cell phone vibration, whatever you are hearing is there just by chance.",

Some time after joining the team, one of the other musicians created their own hard rock Chorale remix by that same name!

Not much to say about this one either other than I should definitely use this theme in the future for something more worthwhile.",

        "commentary": "<i>Erik Scheele:</i>\nThis one is really hardly me, honest, it’s all Bowman. Ruins was this piano recording I’d put up back when I still hardly knew how to record anything, and then Bowman just went and added magic to it. And the piano track, that’s just another one of those “improvisations out of nowhere”, no real purpose or theory-thinking beforehand to delegate anything to it. Especially the descending-thirds, no way I could have just thought about that and been like “Yes that is a good thing to be doing”, it was just spur of the moment thinking.\n(Ruins was one of the first things I contributed to the music forum after getting on the team, a small improvisation based around descending seconds which was made back when I still had no idea how to record things properly. Since Earth was kind of a gigantic wasteland planet at that point (and it still is, today), I conceptually tied my recording in with that, and called it Ruins.\nOf course, I really doubt that Ruins would have gotten anywhere if it wasn’t for Bowman, who pretty much surprised me sometime before Volume 5 with an updated version of my recording, which made the piano sound better and added a lot of other instruments to it, really adding a lot of depth and atmosphere to an otherwise-shoddy recording. And then, when Volume 5 came around, it was released as “Ruins (With Strings)”, which is what you just heard in the update!\nI know I’ve got a better recording of Ruins kicking around here somewhere, I’ll have to see if something can be done with it.)\n<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>\nReally it’s the “(With Strings)” part that is my doing. When Jit was first inducted to the team, he did not have access at the time to a proper recording environment or midi controller that he could apply a high-quality piano sound to, so he had recorded his piano demo for “Ruins” on what I’m guessing is an on-board laptop microphone. I thought the composition was really great but knew that it would sound too unpolished to make the cut onto a Homestuck album, so I resolved to write a string accompaniment around his composition.\nBy applying an incredibly enormous amount of reverb to the piano part, I hid the low fidelity of the original recording and made it sound as though it was hauntingly played to the listener from the other end of a cave. Given my lack of any truly convincing string samples, I chose instead to use deliberately mechanical strings, gently de-tuning them to sound a bit reminiscent of early string synthesizers, somewhat inspired by “Crystal Japan”, a creepy instrumental by David Bowie.\nSome of the other elements of the ambiance (the wind, the really high notes that echo for a long time) I drew from the soundtrack to World of Goo, specifically the track “Jelly” which I noticed bore a strong resemblance tonally to Jit’s composition. To seal the melancholy, I doubled the piano melody on guitar using a very cool, muted sound with a lot of echoes and pitch bends. I signed the tune by adding a cadence from “Sburban Jungle” at the very end.\nReally, the track should probably be listed simply as “Ruins” if not for the fact that there is not official piano rendition of the piece. I think it would be really cool to hear such a version of the tune if Jit ever found himself recording material in a studio again (as he did for James’s piano suite Sburb).",

        "commentary": "<i>Alex Rosetti:</i>\nI consider this an important piece to myself, but not to Homestuck music in general. Actually, it's probably the lowest quality thing I have ever released as Homestuck music. It's just sloppy. But there's a bit more to it than that, and that lies in its instrumentation. This was the first piece I ever composed where I explored colorful and playful orchestration. The xylophone and pizzicato strings that I was playing around with would become my bread and butter a couple years later. I'm not currently known among the Homestuck musicians as being an orchestral composer, but I've reached the point where there's nothing I like composing more than fully orchestrated pieces. At least as far as soundtrack music goes. And not just fully orchestrated either, there's a certain sense of color I love exploring and I like making lighter sounds despite using a bigger and more imposing ensemble. I haven't released anything that showcases that yet, but I definitely will be in the future, so I think that's something to be excited about.",

        "commentary": "<i>Steve Everson:</i>\nMy other favourite from Volume 5. It started life as a theme for the Aimless Renegade, inspired by a “Desperado” theme which I believe was written by Bolin back when he was still part of the team. I wasn’t really running on any particular goal of contributing so much as liking the style and wanting to make something similar. Imagine the piece as it is now played by some sort of mariachi band and you might have the right idea of what it originally sounded like. Naturally, it didn’t quite fit. I liked the melody but it just wasn’t working for the whole desert hero thing. So I flipped through my library of voices (small though it was back then) and came across the more electronic one that plays the melody now. I re-tooled the accompaniment to fit, and it became a piece that I always considered a theme for Derse. Hence its title.",

        "commentary": "<i>Erik Scheele:</i>\nProbably the thing I’m best-known for off of Volume 5, which is slightly ironic given how rushed it was. No kidding, I finished it up the night that Hussie was rounding up tracks to go through, and threw it in as a last-minute thing, “hey I just finished this can it go in??” deal. I mean, I’d had inspiration for it earlier, but never got around to making it until it was almost too late!\nYeah, this one definitely had inspiration. To answer a quick question you might have though, no, I didn’t know about the trolls beforehand, or what Hussie was going to do with the music. I didn’t even find out until Albatross Soup told me about it, a few weeks before it happened. Moreso, the inspiration came from a sudden image I had one night during the summer, in which Jade’s planet, at that time unknown, was highly unstable, and Noir had purposefully upset the balance in order to try and destroy her planet. So the entire first bit is her trying to save her inhabitants, while Crystalanthemums plays. The reason for having that motif, well, I’d had this very strong feeling that it should be Jade’s planet theme. So, it got used.\n(The mental images of one of the kid’s planets getting broken/torn apart like I’d imagined still give me the shivers. I still love Hussie so much for creating a villain that actually did something upon gaining obscene amounts of power; rather than just retreating and launching some master plan, he actually went around and started doing shit with his powers. Not something you even really see in Hollywood villains nowadays, far as I know. The protagonists and antagonists are always very separated, no interaction between one or the other, nothing like what Noir does. At least, that was my experience at the time.)\nAs for the second bit, well, I’d wanted to make an “industrial, heavy action, stuff going to shit” remix of Perrybob’s Mannequin for quite some time, and it seemed to fit to transition over to that. In my head, the action was going to shift from Jade’s planet to LOHAC, where unspecific action was going to take place. I really don’t think I gave the Mannequin section enough time to develop, or really do much, but time constraints dictated I give the music over to the volume 5 collaborative -right then and there-, so it had to be cut off. Mannequin’s really great, though, you should give it <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAyPFa3nEK4&feature=youtu.be\">a listen</a>.\nAlso, as a sidenote, my like for Beck is rather shown in this piece, as is evidenced by my direct attempt to semi-recreate main beat in Replica to transition between the two sections. #MUSICSECRETSSSSSSSS",

The bass progression matches Skies of Skaia's, with more bounce to it, and the melody of Skies of Skaia was quantified/simplified into a repeating motif. It was mostly composed by feel the rest of the way. I actually had writer's block for a while after I reached about 1:02, and it never really got resolved, which is why 1:21 onwards feels kinda awkward and not so great. I kinda wish I could go back and redo it so it sounds better. But what Radiation did with it turning it into Skaian Skirmish worked really well. There was some vague artistic direction from the Big Man that helped with this a little bit. If I remember correctly, it was something along the lines of \"okay, maybe you can bring it down a bit in the middle, then ramp it up for the big finish.\" So I tried to do that using a new bassline, using wandering skips of third and fourth rather than downwise step in an attempt to mirror Skies of Skaia's original melody, as well as scrambling the repeating sixteenth note motif based on the original melody. Like I said, though, I would say it worked out awkwardly rather than well. It does create a certain mood, which, like I said, Radiation capitalized on. Whoops, I just repeated myself, but in more detail the second time. What's that called in literary device terms? Amplification? Yeah, let's go with that.",

Not really any specific inspiration, I just started out with the thought of wanting to make a contrasting piece to Black. Especially with the opening piano line, but overall, something more pure and light. Of course, by the time I got around to finishing it, Radiation had already stolen the title “White”, so I called mine “Light” instead.\nAbout the middle section, I think that needs a bit of talk about it. I’d just been talking with a friend about Homestuck, telling him about the numerical motif 413, and telling him various examples, and he went and said “Yeah, that could be a chord progression too”, and I was like “whooooooooooooooooah”. So I used it as a chord progression. For the first while, though, I had this dual guitar line instead of Showtime, and it was sorta eeeeenh and I didn’t know where to go from there. It sat for a while, then suddenly one day in church I was like “oh holy shit showtime would work so well in there”. It was like suddenly remembering you left a cake in the oven on 500 degrees for the last two nights, that sort of realization. So it went in, and it worked much better than the stupid two-guitar thing.\n413 as a motif, I’ve used it in various ways. Not saying anything, though, not even sure about spoiling its use in Light. If you ever analyze various bits of music, though, you might notice it popping up, or other little fun bits. That’s all I’ve got to say about that.",

The whole thing was written more or less on the fly. The chord pattern is one that I’d liked for several months, possibly even a year or two, without ever having come up with something good enough to write to it. Then, one evening while I was in the shower (all of my best ideas come from the shower) my mind pulled together a half-remembered bassline from an obscure-ish Sonic the Hedgehog game and a brief snippet from an old quiz show called Catchphrase, and strung them into the main harmonies of the piece. From there I just lay an improvised piano melody on top.\nWhen I presented it to the music team it was pretty well-received, and with some of their guidance the whole piece ended up pretty polished.",

I really like how this came out; it sounds a bit moody, but still optimistic, which is what I was aiming for.",

        "commentary": "<i>Steve Everson:</i>\nMy most recent contribution to Homestuck’s music, and another of my favourites. This piece is actually pretty old, going back to before Volume 5, where it was much simpler (playing out more like a round) and with poorer sound quality in general. Like most of my music it was inspired by a similar piece from somewhere else - in this case, the original Bionicle flash adventure game that used to be on the Lego website way back. If you’ve played it, you might notice the similarity, at least as far as instrumentation goes. It had been many years since I’d last even seen the game, long after it fell off the site, so I couldn’t recognise what I liked about the piece and so the imitation I’d made was pretty poor!\nFast forward a year or two. Some discussion with internet friends had led me to find that old flash game again, and I heard my old favourite tune in all its glory (significantly less glorious than I remembered; nostalgia does that to you). Still, it showed me the main place I was going wrong, which was that I’d neglected harmony. All of the three or four lines of music that piece had were monophonic, making a really drab sound, while what I needed where chords. A stupid mistake? Sure, it was, but then, I wasn’t that good a musician when I first wrote the piece. I started over, applying all the experience I’d got both from writing music and simply listening to it with a critical ear to get my main contribution to the Wanderers album, and something I could be proud of.",

        "commentary": "<i>Malcolm Brown:</i>\nAaah this one. This caused me a bit of unexpected grief, but we'll get to that.\nBasically, I wanted to do some kind of Parcel Mistress/PM theme. Representing her transition from postal worker, to warrior, to queen. We start off quite desolate, and we gradually build up to a kind of royal, celtic march.\nThe instrumentation is a bit all over the place (bagpipes, panpipes, probably an Oud somewhere as well). Most of it was attempting to channel various stereotypical \"World Music\" concepts into one track (We're dealing with the remnants of Earth as a setting, so one idea is a kind of combination of different cultural styles - It doesn't fully work, since it's mostly just the instrumentation applied to a fairly simple layout and melody).\nAs for the melody itself, I quite like it - It's very playful and jumpy, yet brings a sense of duty, which fits quite well. Explore also makes an appearance during the kind of transitional \"Wandering\" segment. Also because I really like Explore.\nThe name, and it's worth mentioning I've done incorrect translations before (see Rex Duodecim Latinus), is supposed to be \"Royal Mail\" in Scots Gaelic. It's a bit of a strange pun on PM as a character...\nNow onto controversy!\nAs a few people pointed out when they first heard it, that the notes starting from 0:20 onwards by the sitar are viciously close if not identical to the start of Schala's theme from Chrono Trigger. And yes, yes they are. There is a subtle difference but the majority of the phrase matches. Depending on who you ask this ranges from either an atrocity or an inevitability given the limited nature of conventions and structure of music.\nPersonally, the reference was unintentional. Let's get this straight also, I'm a ludicrously huge Yasunori Mitsuda fanboy. I'm not fully ruling out that at some level I was remembering ST when making LR, but I honestly could not recall the song until someone linked a video, and even afterwards I don't recall the song from the game. There are tonnes of tracks from CT that I recall fondly but ST just isn't one of them. This all said, there was no malevolence nor deceit intended when writing LR and I apologise to anyone offended by it.\nThat's really all I have to say on the matter.",

        "commentary": "<i>Alex Rosetti:</i>\nThe Wanderers is my favorite Homestuck album. Its focused premise, interesting takes on a theme, and general aesthetic all appeal to me. Not to mention the fact that it contains some of the best songs in the Homestuck discography. This song is not one of those.\nI don’t mean to sell myself short, but What a Daring Dream is hard to appreciate on its own as music, and this was intentional. As a matter of fact, I wrote it to underscore WV’s dream sequence, which is one of my favorite parts of Homestuck. And even then, my approach wasn’t as programmatic as Malcolm’s, as he had the same idea with his track, Nightmare. Funny enough, we even ended up giving our pieces the same title, but he was generous enough to change his so that I could keep mine. Of course, because of this the two songs compliment each other very well, and make for a great double-closer to the album.\nI composed What a Daring Dream long before we officially started production on The Wanderers. I actually made the first version of it very shortly after that update came out, it being one of those quick flashes of inspiration. In terms of musical influence, there are a few musical cues from Neon Genesis Evangelion that sounded like the direction I wanted to take. All the ones I listened to had this sort of “stuck in your own head” sort of approach to them, which of course is very suited to their subject matter, and that was the reason I thought this sort of music would be perfect for my piece.\nI wanted the music to be very hazy and meditative, very much like a dream (naturally). Unclear sounds fading in and out, soft messages you’re not quite sure you’re hearing. The use of Morse code was an obvious choice, though I did not have the patience to translate every single line of code in that sequence. I just used the same sample repeatedly, altered it a bit, and panned the two versions of it to each side of the mix. I did, however, think it would be worth my time to whisper the English translation of the Morse code, so throughout the piece you hear my voice narrating ever so slightly in the background, even up to Vriska’s dialogue.\nThe instrumentation was a lucky coincidence since I modeled parts of it off the Evangelion score, and those happened to fit the very broad “Eastern music” theme we were going for for the most part. So the piece turned out to be a great candidate for the album and I worked on it a lot more before submitting it to be on there. Overall it was one of the most fun songs I’ve had the pleasure of making for Homestuck, and the fact that it spooked some people is an added bonus.",
        "lyrics": "What a daring dream, to combine the finest qualities of humanity with the elegance and nobility of the animal kingdom. How you wish you could know their world. To hear one night those muted pawpads traipse up your stairs. A low but friendly growl unsettles your slumber, and as the sopor seeps from your eyes they detect a sharp pair of ears cutting moonlight. A mysterious wolven tongue invites. Wouldn't these ears suit you? Would not this proud long snout assist you in the hunt?\nWhat a daring dream...\n(Just what do you think you're planning on doing with that ring?)<br>(Whatever it is forget it)<br>(The Slayer is miiiiiiiine)<br>(Now w8ke up)<br>(I said W88888888KE!)",

        "commentary": "<i>Malcolm Brown:</i>\nThis one was a bit weird, and went through several revisions trying to figure out what to do. It's loosely designed to be a bit of music for WV's dream in which he effectively turns into Bec Noir and starts killing everything before Vriska turns up disguised as Serenity and makes the whole sequence even weirder.\nFirstly, the concept - It starts of quite dreamlike, then as we get to 1:40 the transformation starts, then there's some more preamble up to around 2:45 onewards, which is the \"Red Miles\" section where everything starts to go haywire. In betwixt there's lots of creepy choirs, weird noises and distorted barking all set to a kind of pseudo Egyptian theme (One working title was 'Anubis')\nHidden around 0:25 onwards is a kind of very subtle reference to Black and an even subtler reference to RDA. After that it's mostly original.\nThere are various samples hidden around the place, like wolf barks and jackal howling. Also all sorts of bizarre human laughter/screaming/conversation that's been reversed and distorted. Then we get to 2:45 and I attempt to kick it into a kind of bizarre Trailer-music affair with a ridiculous amount of percussion and a lot of staccato strings. Oh and those big brass drones everyone loves these days.\nThe ending (3:50 odd) attempts to mimic the beginning of Carapacian Dominion, to act as a kind of bookend for the album. It doesn't do it perfectly, but that's my fault :P\nI quite like this one. I'm not fully sold on the odd sound effects since they're always a bit gimmicky, but the overall theme kinda works. The name was fairly obvious - I did attempt to call it \"What a daring Nightmare\" but Alex Rosetti beat me to it.\nAlso hey, 4:13. Love it when that happens.",

        "commentary": "<i>Tensei:</i>\nI always felt like this song was in a bit of an unfortunate position, being a bonus song on the Wanderers album, which basically meant that only people who bought the album or those who specifically scoured youtube for it would get to hear it.\nSo I’m gonna bring it to your attention and hopefully someone will be hearing it for the first time!\nTomahawk Head was pretty much a full-on collaborative effort between me and Radiation. We had already done some stuff together with the full version of MeGaLoVaNia, but this song was a much more even split IMO. Radiation basically wrote most of the composition in midi form, and I had the task of unleashing my samples and live guitar on it. I also did some minor rewrites, like fleshing out the acoustic middle-section as well as adding the guitar solo section.\nThis song was intended as ARs theme, and uses a lot of (stereotypically) Native American instrumentation. In that sense, it kinda reminds me of a lot of Jade/Bec themes, where there’s an obvious eastern Asian vibe, even though thematically there’s no real canonical connection between Jade and eastern Asian culture.\nI actually consider this a really cool use of ethnic instrumentation. It’s not even the fact that it deliberately tries to go against a stereotype to make a point, but rather that it treats the ethnic instruments as any other: it makes use of the characteristics of the sounds to underline a particular situation or character, and ignores any cultural connotations of the instrument.\nWhen you think about it, it’s pretty silly to assume that Jade has to be Asian because some songs associated with her use ethnic instrumentation. In that sense, I might as well claim that Rose has to be Italian, because hey, that’s where violins originally came from!\nAt the end of the movie Kill Bill, there’s a final showdown between The Bride and O-ren Ishii. They’re both wielding katanas and the setting is a very stereotypical, snow-covered japanese garden. You would THINK that you’d at least get some taiko drums as a backing, but nope. The song that plays is “Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood” by Santa Esmeralda, which can best be described as a flamenco/disco hybrid. And it fits PERFECTLY.\nIn that sense, I think that this song too fits AR very well, even though his character has fuck-all to do with Native American culture.",

        "commentary": "<i>Willow Ascenzo:</i>\nIf [[Violet Mariner]] was the elder child and [[Teal Hunter]] the middle child, then Rust Servant is the youngest child onto which I poured all my love and affection. This was one of my favorite pieces to work on and even today I’m still pretty pleased with how it turned out, from the striking staccato and col legno strings opening the song to the frantic violins, melancholic chromatic percussion, deep brass, and fast-paced drum grooves. I wanted the song to be big, epic, a little scary. If I may be so immodest, I think I succeeded.\nRust Servant was the only one of my three contest submissions to remain allocated to the character I had in mind while writing it, Aradia’s tragic ancestor and Lord English’s dreadful Handmaid (although the name was changed from the terribly uncreative Handmaid of Death to something more apt for the naming scheme of the album).\nWhen I wrote this song, I had just taken an Intro to Hinduism class the previous fall and had written a short research paper on Kali, the Hindu goddess of time and death (more remembered for being related to death—those of you who have seen Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom must be familiar with the Thuggees, a cult of Kali-worshipers infamous for conducting human sacrifices—and, apparently, ripping people’s hearts out and setting them on fire as well). And, of course, because I am A SHAMELESS HOMESTUCK NERD, I immediately thought, “Time? Death? THAT REMINDS ME OF ONE OF THE TROLLS” (no I didn’t write my paper on that, i’m not that terrible). It doesn’t come through much in the song itself, but that’s where I got the inspiration from. And the moral of this story is, take a theology class (or two, or three) on a religion you know nothing about. It’ll give you all sorts of new ideas for Homestuck fanart.\nAlso when the album came out and this song was the first song on the album after Radiation’s intro I was all “HOLY SHIT RADIATION LIKED THIS SONG SO MUCH HE MADE IT THE FIRST SONG” and started pelvic-thrusting across my dorm room. Then I realized that it was only first due to all the tracks being organized from lowest to highest by the blood color of the troll they represented. I continued pelvic-thrusting across my dorm room anyway.\nAnd to wrap things up, milkmanner’s art for the track is just perfect.",

I was at a pretty good time of my life and I was able to work on this thing day in and day out, and so I did, but first I put a lot of though into what I wanted to actually do. I’m a bit of a contrarian when it comes to making music, always trying to figure out what everyone else does so that I could do something different, and so I wanted to make a theme for Tavros that looked at his character from a more serious perspective about what he was and what he wanted to do. It’s original title, “If I were like Rufio,” reflected the melancholy desire to be something or be in a world where he was great, where he was a hero but in reality he couldn’t really amount to much, and it was his own fault.\nFor the style of the song I ended up falling back on one of my main styles, which I called “orchestral cinematic/game with a hint of latin rhythms and harmonies.” I don’t really know what it might actually be called. Unfortunately, while this made the song accomplish what I wanted it to, it can be a bit hard to listen to at times, for being too dependent on situation and scenery.\nHowever I’m very proud of it! I got to practice a lot of new and old things and combine them into what’s currently my longest song! Well, longest I’m not ashamed of. It ended up being allocated to the Summoner, and I had a feeling it would. I’d say close enough, but it feels a bit weird to say that! I wouldn’t change much about it, but I think it’s a bit bland, and I’ve learned a lot from that.",

This song has become the theme of the Psiioniic (and it works freakishly well as such) but I wrote it originally in honor of Bec (to the dismay of some).\nThe song recently made it into the actual comic as the music for the Act 6 Act 6 Intermission 1 animation.

        "commentary": "<i>Willow Ascenzo:</i>\nTeal Hunter was sort of the middle child of my three Homestuck music contest submissions. Even now it’s still my least favorite of the three songs I submitted. Why Radiation picked it along with my other two, I’ll never know. I certainly wasn’t expecting it to be chosen. With over a thousand submissions I’m sure there was no shortage of Redglare songs for him to choose from. Maybe the $20 I slipped him when I submitted my songs had something to do with it But his ways are not our ways.\nWhen Volume 9 came out, a lot of people looked at Radiation’s arrangement of Stress by Buzinaki and started noting similarities between it and Teal Hunter. Radiation wrote about why the two songs sound similar in his commentary for Stress. If we’re going to talk about “what sounds like what”, then I’ll lay my cards on the table and state that Teal Hunter was begun as pretty much a direct reference to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bt_0Lg4-RkE\">00 Gundam</a> from the Gundam 00 soundtrack (if you can’t tell by now, I really like Gundams). When I started the piece, the first draft was more or less a low-rent version of that song, in the same way a cartoon that wants to parody Indiana Jones would get a song that sounds close to John Williams’ Raiders March without being close enough to qualify as plagiarism. So I just kept fiddling with it until the two melodies sounded different. By the time I got to the final product and had added the buildup in the beginning, the two had nothing but their rhythm and syncopation in common.\nTeal Hunter’s original title was Bête Blanche, a play on bête noire, a French phrase literally meaning “black beast” that the fan name “Bec Noir” is most likely a reference to. As evident, the song was originally allocated to PM, the one Exile powerful enough to battle Jack Noir to a stalemate.",

        "commentary": "<i>Max Wright:</i>\nFor those of you who didn’t know, Cobalt Corsair was originally a theme for Hussie. The song being given to Mindfang, while some find it hilariously ironic, I find to be a lot more fitting. I do have a tendency to write piratey sounding orchestral songs; this time it just happened to be accidental! For this commentary, I’m going to be dividing the song up both by sections and instrument groups.\n<b>SECTION I - REGAL</b>\nI always wanted the piece to sound dominating and over-important, at least for this part. It begins with a solo flugelhorn playing its melody, providing an entrance for the rest of the orchestral. After not too long, the trumpets blasting out their fanfare in perfect 4th intervals, the lower brass backing them up with a strong chordal harmony - the brass works to create a very regal sound. Though Hussie as a character isn’t anywhere near this serious, I felt that it wouldn’t hurt to portray him in such a way - the way his character sees himself. The whole thing reeks of overlording and power, which, as it turns out, seems to fit the pirate idea nicely.\n<b>SECTION II - BROODING</b>\nThis is where the piece changes from 12/8 to 4/4, and the solo flugelhorn returns to introduce the new section. I imagined this to be the other side of Hussie, calculating, always working, creating his world. The whole section is just a build up of instruments, as the lower string ostinato loops itself over. There isn’t really much to say about this section, but it certainly works as a contrast for the rest of the piece.\n<b>SECTION III - EXECUTION</b>\nThis is the final minute of the piece, just after the moment of silence. It explodes into a wall of sound, seeking to bring back the power of the first section in a more open way. I actually wrote part of this section before working on the rest of the piece, so naturally, it’s what set the general tone. My favourite melody is introduced in this section (played most obviously by the flutes), and I regret not being able to flesh the idea out more. The piccolo part rising above the rest is interesting - it fits perfectly in with the whole pirate theme, despite me never considering this to be a pirate song. I suppose I consider this section the execution of various plans, to a successful conclusion.\n<b>INSTRUMENT GROUPS</b>\nNow, as you can probably tell from listening, Cobalt Corsair is very dense texturally. To give you a visual idea, here’s a post from a little while ago showing the layout of the sequencer. <a href=\"https://imbrog.tumblr.com/post/23713453688/did-i-ever-mention-just-how-long-cobalt-corsair\">It's big.</a>\nSo, I’ve decided to chop the piece up in terms of the instrument groups, for anyone who wanted to understand what the hell is going on underneath all that sound.\nBRASS | STRINGS | WOODWIND | PERCUSSION AND MISCELLANEOUS <i>(dead dropbox links)</i>",

Before I started composing this song I listened to a shit-ton of battle music from Koh Otani’s Shadow of the Colossus soundtrack, and it shows. Oh, boy, does it show, especially from 0:49 onward with the rhythm and percussion of the piece.\nViolet Mariner was the first song I started working on for the Homestuck music contest that eventually became the coloUrs and mayhem dual album. It’s a song about Dualscar—but it wasn’t always a song about Dualscar. No, it started out as a song about John. This explains the harp/piano section, which plays with the opening melody to Showtime, vaguely darting near it without ever actually producing the exact notes from Malcolm Brown’s original song. I intended it to be more of a hint of John’s original strife theme than a direct reference. In hindsight, keeping the references to existing Homestuck leitmotifs subtle was a smart idea. If I’d been more overt in my references and just made it a straight-up Doctor remix or an explicit arrangement of Showtime, it would have been really hard to reallocate it to a different character. And I’m happy that Violet Mariner is a Dualscar song. Dualscar needs more songs. And also it gave Radiation an excuse to almost name it “Violet Seaman”. And besides, it means I still technically haven’t used the original title, Heirstrike, yet.",

        "commentary": "<i>Plumegeist:</i>\nAround mid-2011 I was at a Nippon Ichi binge. Disgaea 4 was my most anticipated title of yesteryear and I ended up clocking roughly 300 hours in it. Playing it was essentially what finally made me look at the bigger picture when it came to how Disgaea structured it’s entire universe, and if you know me, I love fictional universes with established rules and boundaries that are cleverly told.\nDuring the time I was playing the game I had roughly three or four pipe-projects when it came to comics or visual stories in general, some of which I will delve into soon enough, but generally I come up with ideas for storytelling around one basic principle and I keep them in an idea bucket for whenever I plan on working on them. The projects are things I hope to blend audio and visual presentations to, and as such I often tend to compose music with these projects in mind. Playing Disgaea as such gave me a new idea for a story I since abandoned, and was basically a story of a witch traveling worlds. I decided eventually to experiment a bit with creating some music for a scenario I had in mind, and the only thing I would eventually get out of it was a clarinet melody. The original inspiration was to be Tenpei Sato’s compositions but I never really got to finish it since my laptop had a meltdown.\nIn 2012 I got my laptop back and had backups of all my music files at bay, and noticed that MSPA was having a music competition. The limit was three tracks, and as such I wanted to compose three original pieces just to have a shot at getting in. While I got to composing two however, I was stuck at figuring out where I was going to go with the third one, and I realized that I still had a completely unattributed, unfinished track at hand with this work in progress. After recovering the file, rearranging a bit and ultimately rendering it, I decided I’d send it to the contest since I wasn’t going to really get anywhere with the track. I figured the character it fit the most was Aradia, so I put it under her name and finished it.\nThe idea was to have it be a bit of a grim little insidious melody for a title character, but somehow it ended up being slightly more Grant Kirkhope-ish during the N64 era in retrospect, which is something I have to say I’m kind of proud of since he’s a massive inspiration. I eventually got the call back from Radiation during late February and was told that it won a spot. I was in shock and awe at that point, as it meant that I finally got somewhere substantial with my work. Immediately I re-rendered Rust Maid; then titled Apocalypse Maid, and Orange Hat, and sent it along What Pumpkin’s way.\nHere’s a fun fact though. When Radiation contacted me, he told me that the song was to be retitled “Rust Servant”, and was to be the Handmaid’s theme. This was something I was okay with, but he immediately contacted me a while afterwards and reassigned the character to it’s original intended character. Between a few e-mails exchanged by me and him, we still referred to the actual track as “Rust Servant”, until I got my contract which had it titled “Rust Maid”. I thought this was a contract mistake of some sort, but imagine my surprise when I saw the first track on the album thinking it was mine and not realizing it was adhering to a color scheme. Rust Servant was fucking awesome though.\nAnother fun fact - there’s a cowbell right at the start that wasn’t supposed to be there. I don’t even know how it got there. The original sound file was a reverse cymbal. It happened sometime after I recovered the file and I didn’t notice it until after I listened to the remastered version again.",

        "commentary": "<i>Decon Theed:</i>\nYes, I'm still amused by the fact that the comments on the most popular YouTube upload of this song essentially consist of nothing but \"THIS REMINDS ME OF X GAME\".\nAnd not one of them has ever guessed Baten Kaitos, which provided the primary sources of inspiration for this track (the two Chaotic Dance songs: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B64f48ewdo\">link</a> - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ftFQ_ToXvA\">link</a>). Absolute madness.\nSo. Gold Mage. Originally known as \"Playtime is Over\" and written for Dirk Strider before being repurposed to Sollux. Probably my most successful song, before I wrote that remix of Amalgum from Undertale. The very first piece of music I ever made money on.\nI shan't lie; I'm not as fond of this song as I used to be. Not because of the Homestuck connection or anything; simply because it's just too repettitive. Enough so that it lead to why the eventual remix of it turned out the way it did (too busy and cluttered in places - [[track:gold-mage-playtime-is-over-mix]]) It was so with purpose; I did intend for lyrics to go over this- I even wrote a few- but never recorded anything. But honestly, I can't quite bring myself to hate it. The chords are quite nice, what melodies there are + the basslines are pretty slick, and it was my first major musical success. Though the royalties have since slowed way, way down- it's like £10 every four months, if that- it was a major deal when it first dropped as a part of coloUrs & mayhem: Universe A. Even Toby Fox and (assuming I'm not misremembering entirely) Andrew Hussie had nice things to say about it- directly comarping it to EarthBound-type stuff and being astounded it was written, from the ground up, in a PS1 game.\nI may not be much into Homestuck these days, and I definitely think the song is showing it's age... but, hell, it's special to me all the same. One of the most integral pieces of my early music career by a wide margin.",

        "commentary": "<i>Yan Rodriguez:</i>\nBoy do I love this song. The situation I made was pretty much the opposite of the one for Bronze Rebel. I felt pretty good about Bronze Rebel, and I had a feeling I was only going to get one track on anyway I didn’t have high hopes for this one. In fact this one was the “let’s make something I don’t think others will like as much” song. And it might be true, I can’t really tell!\nI had to fight myself to get this song done, since I wasn’t feeling good and I still wanted to put out something quality. I had really wanted to make something for Vriska, but I didn’t have great sounds to do it, but Solatrus convinced me to try a hand at it anyway, to see if I could do something different with Vriska. Unfortunately, what I had in mind still ended up being like what a lot of people already ended up having as “Vriska” ingrained in their mind from previous official homestuck music. I was a little disappointed about that, but after having spent days staring at the ceiling trying to figure out what I should do, I realized I just needed to make something.\nThe drums were the first thing I had in my mind that I knew I needed to make a certain way, and the way I made the guitar do 9th intervals was initially an accident that worked out for the best. I’m also pretty happy with this one, I only wish I had better samples or actual guitar instead of the weird twangy and low impact stuff I currently do.",
